@WDESCRIPTION:@n

This command shows you the abilities you have learned, how well you know the
abilities, and how much it will cost to improve them.  This command also
allows you to view the abilities available to all classes, including
prerequisite skills, practice point costs, and the levels at which classes can
learn abilities.

Specifying the \"-l\" flag sorts the ability list by the minimum experience
level required for a character of the specified class to first practice the
skill.  Otherwise, the ability list is sorted alphabetically.

Some abilities have prerequisites; skills you need to know before you can
acquire the new skill.  For example, before you can learn second attack you
must learn kick and punch.  The number next to the prerequiste is the level at
which you must have the prerequiste before getting the next skill.

donated.

Having the same account and being logged on at the same time does not always
mean that the player is multiplaying.  They may simply be confused about the

have them create individual accounts to which you should then move their
characters.

"acode trigger init"
"@eDESCRIPTION@n
The functions set_rflag(), remove_rflag(), set_dflag(), and remove_dflag() are
problematic, because each room has only one copy of each flag.  If your
softcode alters these flags, and the area gets saved to disk afterward, the
altered value of the flag will be saved...  and will be the flag's value after
a MUD reboot.  This does NOT concern the status and reset flags, which are
automatically set by the hardcode.

Example: you have a dark room, and elsewhere is an acode for a switch that
sets the \"Lit\" rflag in the dark room.  Since the switch starts out \"not
flipped\", you want the dark room to be dark after a MUD reboot.  If the area
gets saved to disk (because of modifications) after the switch has been
flipped, the next time the MUD reboots, that room will start out lit.

The original approach was to have two sets of rflags and dflags for every room
and door.  The 'init' acode trigger is a better approach.  You can simply have
an \"init\" trigger in the dark room, that removes the \"Lit\" rflag.

The init trigger gets called after all rooms are loaded from disk, but NO
RESETS have yet been done.  The room's status flags will all be set, but the
reset flags will have whatever value they had when last saved.  This means
that any objects you load to the room will be removed by the first reset
(unless they are no_reset, etc.)

Negative Modifers:
Any negatives you have can count for 1/2 their posative value towards the
item.  Negative values should be used with some common sense, only values
which are meaningful to the player likely to use the item should count as
negatives.  Resistences are often good to use as negative values, however
you should not get any offset value from the use of negative resistences. 
You may also reduce the item by 5 levels if it's good or evil only.

Oflags:
Oflags may be put in items to relieve the caster of the leech.  It
should be valued at half the leech of knowing the spell to 1.  If
only those who can cast it can use it.  It also must be as high a
level as the skill.

Oflags may also be used on affects that can be cast on other players.
If a spell can be cast on another player, it should add about 10
levels + the spell level.  Detection spells may also be put on items
at the same expense.

Oflags may only be placed on Neck (base, top), finger (Base), and body
(over).

"Algesa"
"Algesa, the Goddess of Law, is most often seen in the form of a tall, strong
warrior.  She wears shining armor of exquisite quality, though also completely
functional.  Her blade, Divine Justice, is always by her side.  It is a
hand-and-a-half sword, with a golden hilt and a razor sharp but unadorned
blade.

She is the soul of law, favoring neither good, nor evil, but simply seen by
her followers to be absolute law -- swift, sure, and unchallenged.  She is
sworn foe to Ulthi, god of Chaos, and all his followers.  Algesa opposes all
illegal acts, and urges her followers to do the same.  At times, when due
process seems to have fallen by the wayside, Algesa and her followers have
been known to take the law into their own hands, as for they believe, the law
springs from their hands.  Algesa has been known to be an ally with Kerog, as
she believes firmly in the right of war and conquest to uphold and defend
law.  She looks with disfavor, though, on rebellions.

Her symbol is a set of scales balanced on the hilt of a sword, usually a
depiction of the blade Divine Justice.

Algesa is worshipped extensively in Medienne, where the refuge of law is
sought in the aftermath of war.  Surprisingly, Algesa is also followed in
Voaleth, where the word of the Tyrant is breathed to be law itself.  Algesa
only accepts those followers with a commitment to law, and as such does not
approve of roguish elements attempting to infiltrate her faithful.

"align2"
"The following is a listing of the nine alignments.  Definitions and
examples are contained therein.

@WLawful Good@n - Characters of this alignment believe that when people
respect society's laws and try to help one another, society as a whole
prospers.  Player's of this alignment believe that by following the Law, 
they will do the most Good, and will follow rules and laws even if 
they may personally feel that a particular law or rule is wrong. 
(An extreme example of this conflict might be a samurai, who follows 
his Lord's command, EVEN if he thinks its wrong, then commits 
seppuku afterwards to display his personal protest.) Lawful good 
players would most likely gravitate to clans of like mind, believing 
them to be first and best (perhaps only) way to do the most good.

@WLawful Neutral@n - As long as there are laws and rules, this character 
will follow them with no hesitation.  The people that the Law has put 
in charge of the character know better than the character what is right 
or wrong. The player 'knows' this, because the Law put those people in 
charge, and the Law is always right. Therefore, such a player will 
follow all orders without question, and believe themselves to be doing 
the right thing, because following the rules will eventually make 
everything work out.

@WLawful Evil@n - This character believes in using laws and rules for his
own gain.  Even if the character is on the bottom rung of the ladder,
they will follow the rules, and learn to use the rules to benefit
themselves and 'get ahead'.  A lawful evil being would be an iron-fisted
tyrant (like Hitler), part of the tyrants regime (a Nazi) or a devious
individual who uses the rules to get what they want (perhaps a lawyer
working for the mob, or someone willfully using laws to protect their own
unethical behavior.) Lawful evil character's would join a clan whose
rigid structure could be used to benefit themselves, or whose iron
control of resources would make him or her powerful by association.

@WNeutral Good@n - This character sees the need for good.  He or she uses
laws and rules when they will do good, and ignores them when they seem to
be causing harm.  They do what they think is right at the time.  A lord
who violates orders from his king to destroy something he sees as evil
would be considered neutral good.  A player of this alignment might join
a good clan if it seems that clan might allow them to accomplish the most
good (or might _not_ join a clan for the same reason), but unlike a
lawful good character, the NG character might still go against certain
decisions of the clan (covertly or overtly), if they thought the decision
or rule was wrong.

@WTrue Neutral@n - True neutral characters dont much care for good or
evil, prefering to stay on the sidelines.  As long as the law doesnt
intrude upon their goals, they abide by it -- when it doesn't, they
ignore it.  A mercenary who fights only for the coin, caring nothing for
either side, would be truly neutral.  They might join a clan if they
stood a good chance of gain without becoming entangled in 'causes'.

@WNeutral Evil@n - The only interest of this character is getting ahead.
Whether its by means that are legal or questionable, they take advantage
of it.  They don't have the every-man-for-himself quality of a chaotic
evil, but they have been known to betray friends to the authorities for
personal gain.  They might join a clan if that would benefit them the
most, but would leave if the benefits they perceived faded or did not
develop as planned.

@WChaotic Good@n - Strongly independent, these individuals have no use
for any law or rule.  Their own moral code guides their actions and doing
good is a personal thing.  Any means justifies the end result if that
result is goodness.  A vigilante is an example of chaotic good.  Chaotic
good characters usually think that rules and laws hurt more than they
help...  they may agree with everything the laws stand for, but they
think setting down laws is the first step toward ruining the cause.  Laws
are part of the problem, not the solution, and as such, this character
would rarely join an order or organization, though they might if the the
clan represented a very loose alliance or shared philosophy.  A group of
characters who acted independantly of each other most of the time and
follow their own individual sets of morals, but who do work towards a
common goal and share information and support when possible, without a
strict set of rules might be a good example of a clan a chaotic good
player would join, as would a clan dedicated simply to 'acquiring and
protecting knowledge'.

@WChaotic Neutral@n - These people tend to follow whatever whim strikes
them at the moment.  There is no order or reason to their actions, as
laws and rules mean nothing to them -- many change their mind on a whim.
Good and evil do not affect their decisions.  If they cant decide on 
a course of action, they might flip a coin -- heads, give the child a 
toy; tails, burn the child's house down for sport. Chaotic neutrals 
almost never join a clan, as they don't commit to any cause for more 
than a few days before becoming bored.

@WChaotic Evil@n - Chaotic evil characters see nothing wrong with taking
whatever they want how ever they can.  Laws and rules are for the weak. 
The strong have the right to take what they want.  Bloodthirsty bandits
or a rampaging monster would be chaotic evil. Chaotic evils might form
temporary groups (perhaps to destroy and loot a small town), but would 
never join a long term clan.

"Alignment"
"This is a help area designed to give builders a better general
understanding of the religions and the alignments construed therein.
 
The two first tier gods, Algesa and Ulthi, are very dissimilar, which has
already been stated, but here is a simple attempt to clarify these two
religious figures.  Algesa, the goddess of order, has an alignment I call
lawful-neutral.  This means that she actively seeks order in the
universe, but cares not for the stsruggle between good and evil.  Ulthi
is without a doubt chaotic-evil, meaning he takes the side of disorder
and favors evil over good.
 
The second-tier gods, Taranth, Kerog, and Meriada have more subtle lines
of alignment.  Taranth is somewhat clear, being definately lawful,
seeking order, and good rather than evil.  Meriada's alignment is true
neutral, favoring neither good nor evil, order or disorder.  Meriada
furthermore actively seeks to maintain the balance between the forces. 
Kerog's alignment could also be construed as true neutral, but he leans
to both the sides of lawful and evil, seeking the justice that comes with
revenge, and also the atrocities of bloody war.
 
The third-tier gods, Cynnis, Kantos, and Osse, are even more obscure in
their direction.  Cynnis, goddess of nature, is for the most part
neutral, but leans ever-so-slightly toward the good, as her true
creatures are never evil at heart.  Kantos also is mainly neutral, and
yet just as the cold turning of the earth stops for no mortal, Kantos'
alignment swings slightly toward evil, and also lawful.  Osse is also a
neutral god, but just as the sea is whimsical and without order, Osse's
alignment swings slightly toward chaotic.
 
Morr and Temohpab are currently very debateable figures.  Morr, the god
of death and keeper of the dead has no emotion, no swing from neutral. 
Temohpab, whose realm is not yet known, has an order all his own, and is
also most definately in the favor of evil.

"alignment_change"
"So, you want an alignment change.  Well..... NO!!!

All kidding aside, the truth of the matter is you probably aren't going
to get one.  I'll lay down the basics for you so you'll understand where
matters lie.

@WRule #1@n: NO ONE gets to change alignment between Good - Neutral - Evil.
This may have happened in the past, but it is unequivocally not going to
happen now.  Policy stands.
That means no good to neutral, no neutral to good.  No neutral to evil,
and no evil to neutral, and absolutely no good to evil or vice-versa.
Let me clarify good, neutral and evil.  They are the 3 base alignments.

Good = lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.
Neutral = lawful neutral, pure neutral, chaotic neutral.
Evil = lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil.

In other words... Neutral Good means you are of \"good\" alignment, NOT \"neutral\".
In any alignment where neutral is the first word, it means neutrality of
law and chaos, not neutrality of good and evil alignment.

Ok, hopefully we have that little bit of confusion straightened out.  The
last part seems to confuse so many people, and a thorough understanding
of it can save both your and our lives a great deal of mental sparring
over a pointless debate.

@WRule #2@n: You can not change from lawful to chaotic or chaotic to lawful.
Pretty straightforward I think.

@WRule #3@n: Even if you manage the nearly impossible feat of earning an
alignment change once, it will NOT happen again.  For example, if you
start as chaotic good, the best you can ever hope for is neutral good. 
In truth, you probably won't even get that.


Its not that we don't think people can change, we even used to do them
occassionally, but the problem is almost all the time it is for reasons
that are not realistic (realistic being used with some artisic license,
as it means real within the little fantasy realm we have created here). 
In the end, it wasn't worth altering 100 people because 1 person in the
group had a good reason and bothered to follow role playing restrictions
anyhow.  Most people who want one haven't bothered role playing their
alignment in the first place.  The only reason they're asking is to join
a clan or use equipment they can't currently.

So, how can you get one of these rare alterations of your personna?
My suggestions are as follows...

First, ask an imm if they'll even consider doing it.
(After all the hassle, and policy stating we wont we still have the same
100 people trying to argue to change because \"they're reason should be
allowed, even though they understand why no one else's should.\") 
If they say no, don't argue about it.  This is about the only time asking
another imm might work.  Asking an imm after one has told you no we won't
allow you only gets you in trouble because we post such things.  If they
said no because they are tired of the whining (and most of it is whining)
then they'll probably just say no and hope you leave them alone.  Arguing
will only make them mad and work against you.

Second, be prepared to make a commitment.
I tell them to role play their current alignment for about a month.
post notes showing that they are playing that alignment, at least 1
well-written, well-role-played note on stories a week.
Then, over the next month role play the gradual change of character and
post notes on how that's going too.  At the end, if you've impressed me
suitably that you are, in fact, role playing and have some concept about
what the alignment you are and are changing to entails, I'll probably
change you.

A little side-note about the posted notes.  A well-written note may be
short, but more often than not you aren't going to be able to write out
all you need to place (atmosphere, setting, drama, what have you) in a
single paragraph.  Such a note should be posted on stories board, as this
is the story of your character's current life.

(The only exception to these rules may be characters under level 3 who
are just learning mudding and role playing for the first time.  After
that, all rules stand.  If it really means that much to your character,
its more often a better show of devotion to just delete and start over as
a sign of your true change of heart as well as comitment to the change. 
Otherwise, it probably wasn't that important to you.  The last stands for
a level 80 as much as it does for a level 10 character.)

"Anor, Lady of the Moon, is goddess of love, beauty, and music.  It is said

it would stop the heart of any mortal.  But the faithful claim that she does
indeed appear, just in a lesser form, out of her love for her followers.  She
favors the form of a woman with black hair and silver eyes, and is
traditionally clothed in a dress of white.  She also enjoys to appear as a
pure white songbird, though nightingales are particularly favored.  White
roses are said to be hers, especially any that bloom under the light of the
full moon.

Anor is goddess of love, beauty, music, and of course, the moon.  The Lady of
the Moon takes no side in the strife between gods, preferring to see the
beauty in both sides.  She is a kind goddess, though capricious she never sets
out to cause harm.  She is said to be the moon, as that is what looks over
young lovers as they steal out into the night to celebrate their love.

Her symbol can be expressed in several ways -- an old form is just a crescent
moon.  The ornate and formal symbol is a perfect white rose over a full moon,
though the white rose or the full moon are also used separately.

Anor accepts any into her faithful as long as they have a nature to appreciate
love, beauty, music, and the silver light of the moon.  She does not tolerate
destruction, as beauty can be lost and music forever silenced, so does not
accept those devoted to chaos.

hiding (a thief skill) or things that assume how you are clothed.  @eDO
NOT PUT YOUR CLASS IN YOUR APPEARANCE!@n Your race *should* be included (

'mysterious figure cloaked in darkest samite' are not acceptable.)
References to your race should not be capitalized.  And if you wish to
use a number in your appearance, please spell it out.

Your keywords should include every word from your appearance, including
race, separated by spaces, not commas.

Slang such as \"buff, ripped, butch, cool, etc\" is not acceptable and will
not be approved.

Lastly.  you need to set a description.  This is done with the command
@Edescription@n.  After you have set appearance, keywords and description ask
politely over the request channels for any avatar to approve you (\"help

Approve is used to set a character's appearance as approved.  Character

you should make sure they have an appearance, keywords and a description and
that everything is spelled correctly.

Approve -p is used to set the player being edited.  Once set, the approve -k,
approve -a, and desc commands operate on that player.  To clear the current
player, issue the approve -p command with no player name.

You cannot edit the appearance of a player more than 20 experience levels
higher than yourself.  Should you discover problems with such a player, seek
help from a higher-level avatar or an immortal.  Posting your concerns on the
'avatar' noteboard is a good first step.

@b@RPlease@n read \"help appearance\" and \"help keywords\" for guidelines regarding
what is acceptable.  If a player is being difficult or not understanding what
you want, contact an Immortal so they can assist you.
  
@eNOTE:@n Approve -f is not to be used for regular approvals.  In the event that

"area checklist"
"Here's a list of things you need to get a zone into the game:

@eGet your concept approved by Nereus@n
Self-explanatory.  Just drop me a mail or catch me when I'm on.

@eIdentify possible placement locations@n
I'd like to make sure new zones are sufficiently far away from existing areas
to prevent future overlap and overcrowding.  When you consider your area,
please also consider potential location.  Make sure to consider roads leading
to your area and possible transitional terrains, if necessary.  You may also
want to consider checking the jobs board to see if anyone else shares your
idea for a zone or is already working on a potential road or terrain
transition to a location you can place your area.

@eAdd your current work to the jobs board@n
Please add a quick note explaining what you are working on and any other
relevant information you'd like others to keep track of.

@eMap zone and exits@n
While mapping out your zone, ensure that you're not creating overlap.  You
might consider setting terrain types and exit sizes now, although some prefer
to do this later.

@eWrite rooms, extras, and codes@n
Ensure all rooms in the zone have extras and flavor acodes added.  Every room
should have extras, unless there are no_show objects for everything that can
be represented as an object - this should be extremely unlikely.

Dynamic things in rdescs - weather, light, mobs, sounds, smells, and so on -
need to be represented with acodes.  Be liberal with search acodes - don't
just have search codes in rooms where something pops.

That doesn't mean you need to have an acode in every single room, but don't be
afraid to use them for things you think people might try.

@eWrite mobs and add their resets@n
These steps don't have to be in any particular order - some people write the
whole zone first, and some write the mobs and then the room descriptions.

Have a look through help mob_check_list for specifics on what you need to
remember for each mob.

@eWrite objects and add their resets in the zone@n
Again, this step doesn't have to be done in any particular order.

For items in the room description, consider adding objects in the room that
players can interact with.  Is there a table or other furniture?  Big boulders
or plants that might be interesting?  Add an item for them.

@eWrite helpfile for the zone@n
All areas should have a helpfile associated with them.  Write a help file with
the area name, and rset the help file to match the name of the help file
you've created.

@eCheck your spelling@n
The spelling in all your rooms and room extras can be checked with the command
\"roomlist -S\" while standing somewhere in the area.

@eSubmit zone for approval@n
This can be a frustrating step since you're ready for your zone to open, but
it's better to catch issues before players find a loophole that you forgot
about and we have to track down items and remove them from the game.

Send a mail to Nereus - I'll make sure that the appropriate people review your
zone.  Please leave all rbugs in the zone until it's been opened, so if there
are multiple reviewers they can see what comments have already been left.

The mail should contain the following:
- Vnum of the first room in the zone and any notes pertinent to the entire zone.
- Vnum of every mob and object created or loading in the zone.

Once the zone has been reviewed and any issues are closed, mark the zone's
status to open and post an announcement note.

@IThe 'area new' command creates a new, blank area.  The first argument sets
the disk filename to be used for the area file, not the area name.  The second
argument is the vnum of the first room, which is automatically created.  Only
architects and above can use this command.

@IThe 'area delete' command sets the status of the area you're in to
'deleted'.  Deleted areas will not be loaded from disk on MUD reboot. 
However, the file still exists on disk and can be recovered if needed.  All
entrances from other areas must be removed before an area can be deleted.  If
you type this by mistake, 'area delete' can be used again to un-delete the
area; its status will be set to 'immortal'.  Only architects and above can use
this command.

+1 hp/mana/move = +1 level
+0.1 hp/mana/move regeneration = +2 level
30 max hp/mana/move and 3.0 max regeneration, but 20 and 2.0 are strongly
recommended as cap.

+1 poison resistance = +1 level
+1 mind/magic/fire/cold/acid/electric resistance = +2 levels
max of 20 resistance, and it's recommended that items not be overloaded with
resistances.

+1 hitroll = +5 levels, +2 hitroll = +20 levels, +3 hitroll = +40 levels
+1 damroll = +15 levels, +2 damroll = +40 levels, +3 damroll = +80 levels

+1 wis = +15 levels, +2 wis = +40 levels
+1 str = +20 levels, +2 str = +50 levels
+1 dex = +25 levels, +2 dex = +60 levels
+1 con = +25 levels, +2 con = +60 levels

@eNOTES:@n
Spell affects, especially for other classes, are strongly discouraged.  If the
class has it and it's class only, just consider it as leech of mana at spell
level 10.

Underlayer armor should have minimal stats if any.

Main arm, leg, and body slots should have minimal stats.  Main body should
only have int or wis and mana and regen with low ac.

Minuses on items subtract the level by half of how much it would be.  For
example, -10 hitpoints would mean -5 levels to the item.

Try to make the item level and reset rate appropriate to the difficulty of the
mob and area it comes from.  When creating a custom, try to make obtaining
each part to custom the item around the level of the item.

Level costs for weight and durability have yet to be decided upon.

aset                       : shows the current action's stats
aset <field> <value>       : set action flags

@WPARAMETERS:@n

Fields that can be set are:
Trigger: what triggers the acode being edited
Value: used for random or time-based triggers
Command: used to set specific trigger commands
Target: used to set specific targets of the Command Field

Using aset without a field will function in the same mannar as astat.

Using aset <field> without a value will show all values available for that
field.

@eDESCRIPTION@n

To access the aset command, you must first used aedit to target an acode in
the room you are in.  See @Whelp aedit@n for more information on that command.
See also the @Whelp aflag@n file for additional relevant info.

The aset command is used to set the high level values of acode.  These values
determine what triggers the acode.  Not all the fields have to be set, in
fact, certain fields aren't even active or useful without other fields being
set correctly.

For example:
aset trigger entering room - will trigger the code when someone enters.
or
aset trigger searching - will trigger the code when someone has search on.
but
aset trigger random - will require the use of the value field to set how often
the random action is triggered.  Values range from 0-1000 with 1000 being
every tick.

Acodes with the Trigger set to none can only be called from another acode
or with some combination of the command and target fields are also filled.
Both fields can contain multiple options, separated by spaces.
For Example:
aset command 1 open move 2 lift
aset target lid top
would trigger the code with any of the following commands:
open lid, open top, move lid, move top, lift lid, or lift top.

The 1 open in the Command field means the character triggering the acode only
needs 1 letter of the word open to trigger it.  In this case \"o lid\", \"op
lid\", oe \"ope lid\" will have the same effects as \"open lid\".

For commands that appear in the \"Command\" table, it's best not to specify a
minimum required string length.  If you don't the number will default to the
number of characters needed for the command to be recognized on the command
line.  So in the example above, the command should be \"open move 2 lift\",
since \"open\" and \"move\" are in the command table.

@WRETURNS:@n

none

@WEXAMPLES:@n

The possible combinations are too numerous to reasonably list examples.  Read
through the description and take a look at various rooms with triggered
actions in them to see the variety and what results from those settings.

"Ashallan"
"Masked Ashallan, as she is often known, is goddess of thieves, stealth, and
deception.  She has never appeared without her face being obscured by some
form of mask.  Most often, this mask is of black cloth and wrapped about her
head to obscure all but her black eyes.  Ashallan's eyes are dark pools of
shadow, with no discernable difference between iris and pupil, though the
whites can be clearly seen about them.

Patroness of all that is hidden, Masked Ashallan is said to have a love for
secrets, silence, and those who dwell within both.  A frequently told tale
among the faithful ends with the lines: \"So, you can keep a secret?\" asked
Ashallan.  Most often, the other speaker is a god of good, particularly
Lonil.  \"Yes,\" the other god replied.  \"So can I,\" Ashallan whispered, with a
soft grin, and sneaked out into the night.  She grants her protection to those
who rely on wits, agility, and cunning to make a life for themselves out of
this world.  Thieves are especially looked upon with favor among the
faithful.  Masked Ashallan's name has been linked romantically to Temohpab,
granting her some animosity from Iniara, but the Masked One has made no
confirmation or denials of this rumor.

Ashallan's symbol is most often represented as a stylized black mask, though
only the incredibly ignorant believe there aren't further secret symbols used
by the faithful.

Due to her complete disregard for law, Ashallan does not accept any lawful
members into her Den, as the faithful refer to themselves, letting the masses
call themselves sheep in flocks if they prefer.

The @emoon@n revolves around the earth every 39,343 minutes, or about 27.32
days--its @esidereal period@n.  During this time, however, the earth moves on
its path around the sun, so it takes a little longer for the moon to cycle
through its phases...  The moon's @esynodic period@n is about 29.53 days.

A @enew moon@n occurs when the moon is on the same side of the earth as the
sun, and cannot be seen since the far side of the moon is illuminated by the
sun.  A @efull moon@n is seen when the moon is on the opposite side of the
earth as the sun.

The rising and setting times of the moon vary greatly, since the full moon is
always highest around midnight, and the new moon, though unseen, is always
highest around noon.  Also, the moon's path wanders north and south of the
equator.

On this MUD, the moon's zenith gets 49 minutes later each day (a synodic
period of about 29.39 days), and its rise and set times vary according to a
sinusoidal curve, centered around 12 hours visibility time, with the moon's
sidereal period.  The maximum is 16 hours, the minimum is 8 hours.  These
numbers are all gross approximations of the Earth moon, but should be good
enough for a MUD.

The values returned by moon_phase( ) are approximate; since the synodic period
is over 29 days, each phase will last for 3-4 days.

Auction places an item on the @Gauction@n block.  At this point a timer is
started.  Players may bid on an item using the bid command.  To place a bid
you must have sufficent funds in your bank account.  At the end of the time
whoever has placed the highest bid receives the item.  If noone has bid on the
item it is returned to the seller.  If either seller or buyer has quit the
game the transaction still occurs with the player file being modified as
appropriate.  Gold is only transfered between bank accounts so if an item is
sold the seller's bank account will be credited with the bid price (minus the
daemon'e fee of 5%) and the buyer's debited.  The auction undo command removes an
item from the block assuming it is issued shortly after the item is auctioned.
If the buyer's inventory is full, the item is dropped nearby, so be sure that
you have available inventory space before bidding!

You may set how much information you receive over the info channel about
auction with iflag auction.  Level 1 means you only receive a message when an

"Background on Religions"
"Here is some background information on my new, handy-dandy, religions.
----
Back in the day, oh, say 5000 years (old enough for elven memory to be come
misty, though not forgotten), there was something called the Godswar.  The
sides in the Godswar are pretty much broken down the lines as they are in help
religions.

The war ended with a large cataclysm that destroyed many things and changed
almost entirely the face of the earth -- the Vaasa and parts sacred to
particular gods were saved, though not all.  The side of Light won.  That is
why many of the dark races are underground or far from what we consider
civilization.

Temohpab, in particular, was bound from the surface of the earth, until
recently.  He had been sheltered in the earth, by Kantos, who as he wishes to
preserve the earth, could not bear to have one of the essential forces of the
earth lost.  In return for that, Temohpab changed his goal from destruction of
the earth to domination, swearing to Kantos an oath that he will leave the
earth standing.  As a neutral god, Kantos accepted, not caring which force
covered the earth, as long as it remained.

(I'd like to do a lost city zone that was swallowed by the cataclysm -- I
think it would be cool.)

The Slen-Lodar thing explained:
Back before the Godswar, Slen and Lodar were a bit of an item -- Lodar was not
yet called the Black Star, and he was only the God of Mischief.  He wanted to
join the side of Light and be with Slen, but Lonil refused to let his twin,
Ashallan join the light side.  Lodar refused to join without Ashallan, and
turned away from the side of Light.  He turned away from Slen, heading instead
with his sister to the Dark Gods, becoming the Black Star and God of Cruelty. 
He has been festering over his not being good enough to be with the gods of
Light (which is not necessarily true) and their denial of his sister (which
was at Algesa's prompting, as she despises theives), for the past thousands of
years from then until now.  Slen still loves him, and wanted to talk to him --
she made several overtures before and during the Godswar, but he refused to
admit her to his presence.  He still loves Slen, but does not want her to see
what he has become.  He was seduced by Iniara not long after his Fall, and has
felt 'tainted' ever since.  This huge mess has become a bitter hatred between
the clergies, and probably will give us neat zones/quests ideas.

Damage depends on several factors - these include: level, dex, if victim

hit a sleeping or unconcious victim, but an alert victim who can see you
is very difficult to successfully backstab.

"beard rings"
"@CDwarven beard rings and their signifigance@n
  
The diminutive race of peoples know collectively as the race of dwarves
share several common traits that mark their race as a whole.  Among these
traits are their shorter stature than that of most other races, a hearty
endurance, generally a strong work ethic, and the ever-present beard
found on both sexes.  While some races generally find facial hair to be
repugnant, the dwarves all take their beards quite seriously.  To the
dwarven peoples the loss of a beard to mishap is nearly viewed as being
more heinous to the individual than even the loss of a limb.  The dwarf
who chooses to shave off his beard risks becoming an outcast among his or
her own people who will wonder what is fundamentally wrong with the
individual.
 
Needless to say, that among such strong feelings about their beards,
beard fashion would tend to become a subject of interest.  An early
forerunner in the beard fashion parade was, and remains the twin braids. 
Among other schools of thought single braids, multiple braids, unbraided,
and countless cuts and styles are also popular.  One underlying precept
that took hold early on, and continues to be a highly esteemed practice
among the dwarven peoples is the fashion of the beard ring.  Having taken
a strong hold as a consistent fashion statement, the upper eschelon of
dwarves managed to orchestrate the whims of fashion to serve a practical
purpose.  Over centuries fashion became custom and the plain unmarked
rings have become symbols of ones status within dwarven society.
   
Though the dwarves talk little of it to outsiders, considering it
something of personal matter, outsiders have learned the following things. 
There are seven metal types used to mark the various levels of
achievement: bronze, copper, silver, gold, platinum, steel, and mithril. 
Young dwarves are not permitted to wear the rings at all until they have
proven themselves by act and deed.  Once proven experienced enough to be
a member of society, the dwarven individual is permitted to wear the
bronze rings.  As individuals earn honor and achievement they are
permitted to purchase rings that mark the gaining of prestige among their
kindred.  Most dwarves eagerly await the day when they can purchase their
first set of rings and strives to improve their standing every day of
their life.  Only a select few have ever been accorded the honor to wear
the mithril rings, and there is even a dwarven legend of one great
dwarven warrior who so embodied the dwarven ethic and achievement that he
was accorded a set of adamantine beard rings.

"Bless"
"This cleric spell, learned very early in one's career, invokes the blessing of
the cleric's deities upon the target of the spell, whether that target be the
cleric himself or some other ally of the cleric.  The blessing, while in
effect, will increase the chance that one has to hit one's enemies while in

shoot <target>    : This allows you to shoot at a specific target in the

inflicts, though your target's status will always show up as

Also, once a creature has been hit once with an arrow, it will tend to be
extremely wary and is very likely to dodge any future attempts to shoot at it.
"
"@c*** Immortal Notes ***@n

To create custom mob reactions to being shot at, create a new mprog with
command trigger 'shoot' and use the following sample code:

if( vnum( ch ) == 2462 ) {
  junk_mob( ch );
  interpret( mob, \"yell Ouch!\" );
}
else
  continue;

Note that 'ch' is a placeholder mob that the bow code loads to try to activate
the 'shoot' mprog being run.

If junk_mob( ch ) is not present, the bow code will use the default AI program
to determine the mob's reaction.

Therefore, in the sample code above, if junk_mob( ch ) was removed, the mob
would yell \"Ouch!\", then either chase down the player, or run away depending
on how badly it was hurt, aggressive/wimpy flags, etc.

As currently written, however, the mob will yell \"Ouch!\" and otherwise not
ahot shot

"Build Process"
"@eTHE CURRENT PROBLEM@n

Several of us discovered at once that an item, the rune stones, had been in
game on a relatively low-level mob.  (level 10 mob had an 89% chance of having
a rune stone each spawn) As far as any of us could tell, these were meant to
go with a level 60-80 weapon that never went live.  Granted, they alone don't
cause any harm but an item that buffs up a potentially 60-80 weapon on a level
10 mob, if the weapon was ever put in players would have a way over-balanced
start.  A brief review showed no one knew it had gone live, that it had been
live for quite some time, and that it shouldn't have been.

Now, the above issue, while pertinent, isn't as important as the issue at hand
which is that some things are going live without a complete and sensible
review.  New zones go live after a rough review process and that helps
immensely but could still be firmed up a little more.  New items and mobs
going into existing live zones currently has no review process and holds the
potential for some very bad results.  The problem is then that these things
need to be revised and dealt with.

Side comment, its not particularly my place Talis to implement new
procedures.  That's basically the Demigod's job.  I offer my apologies to Orb
if this is stepping on her toes but I know she's unavailable right now and she
can readily enough modify or remove any plans I come up with.  In the mean
time, I'm just presenting a draft guideline I feel (as do a majority of imms
available) will benefit the build process.


@eTHE BUILD PROCESS - REVISED@n

@GNEW ZONES@n

@b*@n The description, general plot purpose, and guideline for new zones should
be discussed with an Architect (see help powers) before it is begun.  Once
approved, building may begin.

@b*@n All new zones should be reviewed before going live.  A Reviewer (see
help powers) or Architect, or someone appointed by an Architect, may review
the zone prior to it going live.  Once all revisions required are made and an
Architect gives final approval the zone may be flagged open.

@b*@n When submitting a zone for review, please try to have a list of all new
mobs and new items being added for the reviewer.  It helps ensure nothing new
will be missed.

@GNEW MOBS/ITEMS IN EXISTING LIVE ZONES@n

@b*@n All new items and mobs should be reviewed with the same quality that a
new zone is reiewed.  A Reviewer, Architect, or someone appointed by an
Architect should review any new items or mobs before they are added.

@b*@n New mobs/items going into a live zone need to be placed with care.  All
such changes should be discussed with the Architect.  If the immortal who
created the zone or who is currently in charge of it (if any) is available,
they also should have a say in the matter.


This is a work in progress, feedback is not only welcomed, it is encouraged. 
By the way, let me also add while I am the Architect in charge at this time,
this is in no way a bid for personal power.  I don't want anyone thinking I'm
just coming up with all this to try and take control of the mud.  In fact, I'd
probably be happier just being oblivious and going about my way building and
all the tasks that an Architect is supposed to be doing will greatly sap what
time I hae to build.  ;) Fortunately, I've also been thrust into enough
administratie type rolls to know I can do this and I'd personally much rather
see it done then left as vague as its been before.  I also do this with the
backing of as many immortals as are available currently to offer feedback.  If
anyone has problems with this, please speak up (Particularly Orb as the
Demigod).  My main goal is to keep things sane and organized.  Things aren't
critically bad or anything but everyone seems to agree a bit more organization
in the build process is needed and this seems to be the first step.

cards away from players.  That would be impossible, since players can wander
away, or even quit, with cards from your deck during the game.  However, when
you start a new game and deal to a player still holding cards, you will be
unable to since you don't use \"deal -a\" on the first hand...  you can ask them
to discard their hand or leave the game at that time.

@RIMPORTANT@n: If you join a card game, make sure you have \"message equipment
3\"...  or else the dealer can remove the deck and hold a new one without you
knowing.

The suits, from highest to lowest, are:
  Candles
  Bells
  Wands
  Swords

There are four face cards in each suit, from highest (13) to lowest (10):
  Knight
  Magus
  Priest
  Rogue

The one-card (Ace) is called the Star.

@b@WPARAMETERS:@n

spell - Name of spell to cast

target - The target of the spell: a character or object
level - optional casting level of the spell
speed - optional casting speed of the spell

@eRETURNS@n

An integer:
  0 if the casting failed.
  1 if the casting sequence has begun.

@b@W@CDESCRIPTION@n:@n

Causes char to cast spell on target.

There are a number of reasons why cast_spell() might fail and return 0:
  - Null caster.
  - Caster isn't standing, or is silenced, entangled, drowning, etc.
  - Bad target for the specified spell.
  - Spell can't be cast in the current room.

If the skill argument is omitted or zero, the spell is cast with the caster's
skill level.

The speed argument causes the casting steps to proceed as if the spell were
cast at that skill level...  the higher the level, the quicker the casting
occurs.  If you omit the speed argument, the specified (or default) casting
level is used.

The actual casting delays, in sixteenths of seconds, are:

cast_spell() to first spell.action:
  delay = max( 5, 10 - speed/2 )
  (that is, a minimum of 5/16 second)

spell.action to next spell.action:
  delay = 35 - speed

check_skill( char, skill, chance )

@ePARAMETERS@n

char - pointer to character
skill - name of a skill
chance - integer, modifies difficulty level

@eRETURNS@n

Zero if skill fails
Nonzero if skill succeeds

@eDESCRIPTION@n

check_skill performs a random check, based on the character's skill level,
whether use of a specific skill will succeed.  If the \"chance\" parameter is
zero or absent, the basic probability of success is ( 10*skill_level - 5 ). 
Thus, the chance of success is 0% at level 0, 5% at level 1...  and 95% at
level 10.

If the \"chance\" parameter is positive, it indicates the percentage chance of
immediate success.  So for example, if chance == 50, the chance of success is
50% at level 0, 52.5% at level 1, ...  and 97.5% at level 10.

If the \"chance\" parameter is negative, it indicates the chance of immediate
failure.  So for example, if chance == -50, the chance of success is 0% at
level 0, 2.5% at level 1, ...  and 47.5% at level 10.

@eEXAMPLE@n

if( check_skill( ch, climb, 10 ) ) {
  send_to_char( #char, ch );
  act_notchar( #room, ch );
  transfer( ch, find_room( 24048 ) );
  use_skill( ch, climb );
  act_notchar( #arr, ch );

      or single class alignment @bmay@n be overlooked)
@I@b*@n Certain races may not be in a clan together.
     - elves/vyans typically may not be in the same clan.
     - dwarves/goblins typically may not be in the same clan.
     (In the case of a clan that takes its members from a single
      alignment or single class racial barriers @bmay@n be overlooked)
@I@b*@n The minimum level for clan members is level 10.
@I@b*@n The minimum level for clan leaders is level 20.


@GOther Options Available@n

Using the clans -o function the following flags can be set for the clan:

 Exist.Known - All players will be able to read your clan charter.
               Turning this off makes your clan anonymous.
 Members.Known - All clan members will have the clan name displayed on @bwho@n.
               Turning this off makes your clan membership anonymous.

"Clerical Training Grounds"
"A traveling bard and follower of Temophab recently was heard singing of a
mithril door located deep within the ancient stronghold now occupied by the
cult of Morkith.  While no bard may be fully trusted, most songs ring with at
least partial truth.  According to the song, the door is located beneath a
midnight black temple and guarded by twenty foot denizens from the plains of
hell itself.  Those wanting to gain access need not fight these fearful
guardians but must instead find a magical means of access through an arcane
language...  listeners to the song believe that this language was contrived by
the singer.  Once having gained access, according to the bard, a world opens,
or as he puts it worlds of fantastical wonder including the plane of the dead,
the plane of the nether, a warriors dream of a world comprised entirely of
sword blades and an ancient land frozen in time...

done but please feel free to add any extra's - particulary as new code is
written by GC.  
    
 - Karn
  
#27002    - aedit 1, a gate opener, checks for clan.
          - aedit 2,3 entering and leaving room sends messages to
            another location.
#27003    - some simple levers and something to look at their current
            status.
#27005    - no action code, instead this was my first quest, check out
            qedit 5, and the objects in the room, use 'reset' to find
            what resets in the room. Note - that you can't see one of
            objects. (be carefull this can be a nightmare to edit)
            Oh, the quest is first given to a player by the mob
            Lampster - vnum 245
#27545    - This is one of my more complicated rooms. Basically the first
            two actions (stand inside, stand outside) set a 'condition'
            which the last program uses and the third action (leaving
            room) cleans up the status flags.
            The nasty program is the last one which basically either sends
            the player to a 'hell' if they've stuffed up the instructions
            or randomly gates in a Demon for the player -from which they
            need some reagents to complete the quest.
#218      - Complex use of reset0 and reset1.

"Custom"
"@eSYNTAX@n

@Gcustom@n          : lists items shopkeeper can make
@Gcustom@n <item>   : hands shopkeeper ingredients and requests item

@eDESCRIPTION@n

Some shopkeepers are able to manufacture rare, special items that often have
magical properties.  To see if this is possible in any given @Eshop@n type
\"custom\".  If you see an item there you want, you will need to find the
required ingredients.  Then have them in your inventory and type \"custom
<item>\" at the shop, and the item will be created for you.

@R*** WARNING ***@n
Make sure you type the name of the item to be customed exactly as it appears
in the shopkeeper's list!  If you do so, you are guaranteed to get the right
item.  If you don't, and more than one item matches what you typed, you may
not get what you wanted.

As an example, one shop currently customs both \"steel plate armor bracer\" and
\"steel armor arm plates\".  When a player typed \"custom steel arm plate\", he
got the bracer, which isn't what he wanted, since it was first in the list and
both items matched what he typed.  The order of the keywords doesn't matter!
However, completely-matched words count twice as much as incompletely-matched
ones, so if he had typed \"custom steel arm plates\" or (recommended) \"custom
steel armor arm plates\", he would have gotten what he wanted.

You may notice that the weight of the custom item doesn't equal the combined
weights of the ingredients and components from which it can be made.  Quite
often while manufacturing a custom item, a shopkeeper will add quantities of
common materials, or discard useless bits and pieces of the components.  It's
all included in the custom price.

If you see \"***\" in the \"level\" column, the item is either beyond your
experience level, or cannot ever be used by one of your race, size, class, or
some other characteristic.  You can still custom the item, but you might never
be able to use it.

"custom_fit"
"The custom_fit oflag is used to customize the size of an object to a specific
player or mob.  It has two basic uses, outlined below.

1. Customing items in shops

When a player customs an item in a shop, and the item has the custom_fit oflag
set, the item is fit to the player's race.  However the player will be
@eunable to custom@n the item if it has the race_specific flag but not the
player's race, or the size_specific flag but not the player's size, set.

2. Resetting items worn by mobs

When a custom_fit item is reset on a mob (whether held or worn), the size of
the item is set to match the mob.  If the mob has a player race, the item will
be fit for that race.  Otherwise, it will be fit according to the mob's size.

"Cynnis"
"Deep within the multi-colored canopy, hidden amongst the fauna of the
forest lives the goddess known to all who follow the ways of the
woodlands: Cynnis, guardian of nature.  She is known to her followers as
the Lady of the Forest, or simply Mother Nature.  She loves and looks
after all the plants and animals of the world, but Cynnis always has a
special place in her heart for the verdant green forests.  For this
reason, she has attracted a large number of ent and elven followers;
indeed, many woodsmen and hunters are devoted to her because of her
intrests in the woodlands and the animals that make them their home.

Not a forest in the land has escaped the gentle hand of Cynnis and her
followers.  Cynnis believes natural beauty to be the highest form of
perfection, and considers any unnecessary alterations of this tangible
perfection a perversion.  She does, however, grudgingly allow the peoples
of the earth to take what they need of Nature's abundant resources,
though those who seek to wantonly destroy her lands often live to regret
it.  Cynnis recognizes the needs of both predators and prey, as death is
merely a part of life's natural cycle.  The willful destruction of her
creatures, be they the flora or fauna, however, is not tolerated.  In
respect for the land, followers of Cynnis do not wear steel.

Those who claim to have seen the Lady of the Forests in her domain claim
that she appears as a large, snow-white wolf, a very tall and graceful ent, or as a beautiful
elven archer, her hair a mane of honey-gold locks, carrying a longbow of
silvery white birch that seems almost alive.  Even without actually
seeing her, though, there is not a woodsman who has not felt her serene
prescence while amidst the wooded groves.  Her symbol is that of the wolf
whose form she sometimes shares: large, with a shimmering coat of purest
white and brillant green eyes representing the natural world she holds so
dear.

"Cynnis, Lady of the Forest, is the guardian of nature.  She protects the

with golden blonde hair, dressed in shades of green and white.  More often,
Cynnis takes the form of a large wolf with snowy white fur.

Cynnis is the daughter of @CDawnstar@n.  Left behind when @CDawnstar@n left the world,
she took on the mantle as goddess of the forests of the world.  She has little
to do with her father, @CTemohpab@n, or her aunt, @CShantara@n, for their betrayal

"When you are overcome in battle and you die, your soul is taken to the paths
of death.  Death, in his infinite wisdom, will grant you another chance to
achieve your life's goals at the small price of 1/4 of your life's
experience.  However, when you are returned to the realms, you are weak, and
disoriented.  This does pass after a short time, and you will soon be at your
maximum capacity once more.

A part of the reason you are weakened when you die is because your spirit had
to use some of its essence to recreate a body to inhabit.  You're former body,
now divested of life, is no longer suitable and can not be used for the
purpose of sustaining your spirit.  The remains you leave behind will often
contain a few pieces of your gear that did not return with you when you
returned from Death.  Those remains will eventually decay.  The time it takes
to decay varies a little with each death but is generally a little under an
hours time.

If you are not able to recover your own corpse and the items left on it,
anyone whom you have befriended may recover them for you.

If the MUD is intentionally rebooted by an immortal, gear that remains on your
corpses (only those on the ground) will be transported to your bank vault.

@I Description allows you to write a message of who your character is. 
It is displayed either when someone looks at you, or uses the @Eqlook@n

as well as any other information you feel someone could gather from your
appearance.  It does not include emotions or anything which another
player could not realistically gather from merely looking at you.  Please
note that a description is generally at least one paragraph of at least a
half-dozen or so sentences in length.  Writing your description,
@Eappearance@n and @Ekeywords@n is @bmandatory@n for advancing beyond the
fifth level of experience.  Once you have written a description, see the

* Do not force the judgement of the viewer; i.e., \"You become afraid,\"
    \"you get hungry just looking at...,\" you want to beat his head in.\"
* Do not include actions; i.e., \"As you watch, his hair turns pink,\" \"He
    grabs a tree and uproots it.\"
* Do not include clothing or other removeable objects.  Tattoos, items
    braided into hair/beard, and scars are fine, though.
* Do not capitalize race in your description or appearance.
* @EDo@n include things such as eyecolor, hair color, height,

Command options:
1 - set the flag for only one side

Some useful dflags:
Plural - messages refer to plural doors, e.g.  \"The wooden double doors are
closed.\"
No.Scan - scanning through the exit will show \"unknown\", regardless of whether
any creatures are there or not.  Far-scan will not proceed beyond a no.scan
exit.
No.Pass - the pass_door affect won't allow passage through the door, for those
levels 92 and under.
No.Blink - the blink spell will not consider this exit.
No.Path - will be excluded from path() results.

When adding a @enoun@n to a dictionary, make sure you add the plural form.  For

possessives like \"thing's\" or \"things'\", since the spelling checker
automatically checks the root word when it encounters these.

Proper nouns must be capitalized in the dictionary.  Do NOT add proper nouns
that are also non-proper nouns, e.g.  Stone (as someone's last name) or
Tombstone (as a town's name).

When adding a @everb@n to a dictionary, make sure you add all the additional
forms.  For example, if the verb is \"push\", be sure to add:
@Ipushed, pushing, pushes
@Ipusher, pushers (but NOT pusher's or pushers')
@Ipushy, pushiness, pushier, pushiest, pushily

Of course, not all of these forms will apply to all possible verbs.

Hyphenated and abbreviated words are supported, e.g.:
@Icul-de-sac, hocus-pocus, e.g., etc., i.e.

This command allows avatars to dock gossip points for rule violations.  All

Dockings can be seen by all avatars on info using the \"admin\" iflag.  It is
strongly suggested that all avatars set this iflag to level 3.

The docked player will see a message indicating that he has been docked gossip
points, along with <reason> if specified.  The player will not see the docking
avatar's name.

After a player has been docked, no other avatar may dock that player until the
original docker quits, docks someone else, or types \"dock self\".  This
prevents multiple avatars from docking a player for the same offense.

If, after docking, a player has negative gossip points, his title will be
reset to the default.  He will be unable to set his title until he has 0 or
more gsps.  Also, players with negative gsps cannot post notes.

You cannot further dock a player who already has negative gossip points.

"Druid"
"Druids are the guardians of nature and are bestowed with gifts of magic to
enable them to protect their habitat.  Typically a druid will pick one area
and protect it from outside hazards, however, younger druids are known to
wander the land learning what they can from all the different habitats they
can observe before settling down.  All druids are at home with nature and find
civilization to be somewhat unsettling as most civilized races must coerce the
land and its nature to make it \"civilized\".

Druids are in many ways similar to rangers in their love of nature and the
abilities given them.  Where a ranger can be said to be the physical warrior
of nature the druid is gifted more strongly in the way of magic.  Druidic
spells are primarily concerned with effects found in nature.  The ability to
mimic plant and animal effects or the effects of the elements themselves.
Druids are also given some ability to repair the wounds of the world and heal
wounds.

Druids will not use bladed weapons since bladed weapons are one of the
greatest threats to a forest's growth and well being.  They also typically
avoid the use of metal armor as it both requires significant damage to unearth
most times and interfers with their magics.  The lesser amount of metals in
such weapons as mace heads and hammer heads are considered a tolerable cost to
accept in lieu of their ability to safely wield in defending the woods.

To see a listing of the spells available and physical abilities available to
druids, see the help file on @GAbilities@n.

Height: male and female about 3'6\" - 4'6\"

Hair: primarily black to dark brown, lighter brown
      and blond are rare.  Gray in old age.
      ALL DWARVES (male and female) HAVE BEARDS.

Eyes: Black, brown, gray, green, and rarely blue iris.
      White around the iris, though the iris is large.

Affiliation: Dwarves are a light race.

Appearance: Dwarves are noted primarily for two traits.
First, dwarves are shorter than humans and have broad shoulders.
Second, all dwarves have beards.  While you could possibly shave every
day, every other dwarf is encouraged to shun, taunt and torment beardless
dwarves at every given opportunity.
Dwarves tend to have hearty, strong appearances and are generally adapted
to living in the harsh conditions of the northern Cairn mountains.  They
frequently have dusky, leathery looking skin that protects them from both
chill wind, glaring sun and rugged terrain.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Dwarf@n

Dwarves come from a culture that cherishes two things above all others. 
Family and work.  Most dwarves will place family and clan above friends. 
Sure, a human makes a good aquaintence, but if it came to a choice of
friends of family, family will win hands down every time.
Since family is rarely threatened, except maybe by orc or goblin raids in
the mountains, outsiders more often see the dwarven work ethic come into
play.  A pride in work done, most often with the hands.  In many cases
this means well cared for equipment, fine smithing (one of major exports
of the main dwarven citadel, Kha-da) and a belief that a job worth doing
is worth doing right.

Most other races will see dwarves as obstinate and gruff.  These are more
realisticly just the visual appearance of their ethics.  If something
falls into a category their ethics already cover, it takes little thought
and there is almost no chance of changing a dwarf's mind once its made up
on such a basis.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Dwarves prize other dwarves above all else, making for a pretty gruff
appearance at best to outsiders they do like, let alone ones they don't.

Dwarves have an undying hatred for several races - among them goblins, orcs,
trolls and ogres.  Of these all, dwarves cannot stand goblins who are, to
them, less than worthless thieves who should be buried under the next
collapsed tunnel.

Vyans are perceived as a particularly sinister threat due to their
obvious intelligence and particularly vile brand of evil.

Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism, at times bordering on
contempt.  Severe differences in dwarven and elven attitude make elves
seem capricious and frivolous, something no self-respecting dwarf would
find desirable (see notes on dwarven work ethic).

Ents are viewed with some of the same skepticism as elves but never with any
contempt.  While they lack the caprivious and frivolous nature of elves they
spend entirely too much time with the elves for the liking of dwarves.  Still,
ents are generally a good people and trustworthy.  If not for the ents'
general distrust of dwarves and their preference for axes the ents and dwarves
might even get along quite well.

Humans, on the whole, are seen as unnecessarily volatile and a race which
really hasn't finished its adolesence, grown up, or figured out what it
wants to do with itself.

Lizardmen are considered somewhat of a boggle for dwarves, sharing no
common territories of cultural ideologies that would bring them closer
together or further apart.

Gnomes are considered to be most agreeable, sensible folks closest to
dwarves in attitude and demeaner.

Halflings are considered somewhat reliable if a bit too care-free and are
viewed somewhere between gnomes and humans.  While they can be sensible
folk when it comes to settling down and tilling the earth or working, and
they don't just rush into things, they are just so darned merry all the
time even when there's no good reason to be.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

<subj> is any one of the following: note, mail, desc, or journal.  There are
some editor functions that only work for a specific subject, so make sure to
read the help on @Enote@n, @Email@n, @Edesc@n, and @Ejournal@n before going much further, if
you haven't already.

It is often simplest to write your message one sentence at a time.  This is so
that you can insert lines of text between what you have already written (use
even line numbers for this) and format it afterwards, using <subj> #-#, which
will make your sentences into organized paragraphs.

If you want to insert a line of text which happens to be the same as one of
the editor commands (e.g.  \"note spell\"), use a line number (\"note 5 spell\").

@CADVANCED USAGE@n

Each player has two text buffers--the undo buffer and the paste buffer--which
can be used to make text editing easier.

The undo buffer holds the last state of the message prior to the last editor
command, even if it was just \"<subj>\" to list the message.  In fact \"<subj>
undo\" simply copies this buffer into the current message.  This allows copying
of an entire message from one place to another.  For example, if you have a
mail message you want to copy into a new note:

@Imail edit #
@Imail
@Inote new <subject>
@Inote undo

The paste buffer is used by the cut, copy, and paste (+) commands.  Cut and
copy place portions of the current message into the paste buffer.  Paste
(\"<subj> #+\") inserts the contents of the paste buffer at the line number
indicated.  The paste buffer is not cleared when a new message is selected, so
it can be used to move or copy sections from one message to another.

Height: males about 4'8\"-5'8\"
        females about 4'6\"-5'6\"

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white/blond) to a darkish brown.
      Very rarely black.  Elves have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue, though other colors such as amber, lavender
      or other light colors are not wholely uncommon.

Affiliation: Elves are a light race.

Appearance: Elves look much like humans though they generally have a
smaller, slenderer build than humans.  Elves tend to have smooth,
unblemished skin ranging in all normal human skin tones and what humans
would refer to as an ethereal beauty.  Their skin tone is almost always
touched by the healthy glow of sunlight or the silver sheen akin of
moonlight.  Their appearance often gives them an air of regal grace and
their stoic appearance gives them a haughty, uncaring appearance.
Elves age extremely slowly.  You probably won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for a few hundred more years.  Elven hair
typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.
Elves have ears that are upswept and pointed.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Elf@n

Elves refer to themselves not as elves, but as llewyrr; elf being a term
humans devised.  All elves on ForestsEdge originated from the Vaasa,
whether that means they were born there, their parent were, or at the
most their grandparents were.  The elves of the Vaasa share a very strong
sense of cohesiveness, primarily due to their status as an elder race in
tune with all the forces of nature.  For this reason the elves of the
Vaasa consider any elf kindred, even if that elf was born outside the
Vaasa and knows nothing of it.
Elves tend to hold themselves aloof from all races save other elves and
occasionally ents.  Long years of dealing with dark races followed by
long years of miscommunication between humans and elves (resulting in
several wars, the most recent of which nearly destroyed Medienne and only
ended a scant few decades ago) has caused the elves as a race to become
withdrawn from other races.
Elves tend to prefer nature colors of green and brown that helps them
blend in to the surrounding forest.  Many elves born outside the Vaasa
prefer to wear other colors chosen to display their ethereal beauty to
its best advantage, another trait Vaasa born elves tend to eschew as much
as calling themselves elves.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After centuries of dealing with the hostile invasions of outsides elves
are quite withdrawn.  They view only elves and ents as trusted insiders.

Elves consider halflings a joy of the world and view them as one might a
cute child, though they offer them the respect due their age.

After losing the whole of the Medienne wood, once a part of the Vaasa, to
the humans and years of warfare humans and elves have only recently begun
to trust one another again.  Elves consider humans a goodly race, though
once betrayed are quite willing to hunt down humans on an individual
basis.

Elves treat lizardfolk, dwarves and gnomes with caution having little
understanding of what drives them nor reason to distrust them.  As they
serve the light they make good allies in a pinch and, at the least, they
are less mercurial than humans.

Elves hate all races that serve the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres, and
trolls) but they especially loathe their close kin the Vyans.  Vyans are
quite obviously related to elves though a distant schism between the two
races has caused an enmity that has become the typical embodiment of
light versus dark.

enter <door|direction|room name>

The \"enter\" command provides an alternate means of movement.  In general, you
can specify a direction, the name of a door, or the name of an adjacent room
to move there.  For example, if the room description says there is a shop,
\"enter shop\" will usually work instead of specifying the direction.

In some locations, you may see special places you can go.  For example, if the
room description says there is a large hole, you can try \"enter hole\", which
may move you to a place that can't be reached by simply moving in a compass
direction.

"@GAverage Statistics for Ents@n

Height: males about 6'6\" - 7'6\"
        females about 6'10\" - 8' tall.

Hair: Bristly or \"twiggy\" in earthy tones
      Primarily dark to light browns, red-brown, sandy-blond and
      shades of gray and sometimes black.
      Most ents, but not all, including females have bristly/twiggy beards.

Eyes: Also in earthy colors.  Blacks, grays, browns and greens
      predominate though silver and gold are not unheard of.
      Their iris extends to the edge of the eye (no white exposed).

Affiliation: Ents are a light race.

Appearance: Ents have craggy, tough skin that is usually a dark brown and
looks surprisingly like troll skin (only without the warts, bristly hair,
or slime).  Ents have wide feet with seven toes on each foot but ents
still only have 5 fingers on each hand.  Ents tend to have bulky physical
forms (unless you've given your character a very low strength and
constitution).  Ents are not treants and do not have bark, sap or leaves.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ent@n

The ent is the largest of the humanoids that tends towards the side of
light and goodness and, as such, most are slow to anger realizing their
great size and strength can cause great devastation and they would not
want to cause undue harm to innocents by mistake.  Somewhere in the
time-shrouded past ents became the primary caretakers of the plants of
the ancient forests, primarily the Vaasa, and they usually live
peacefully among the elves of the wood.  Most ents are slow to speak or
act as they have long life-spans and have lived so long tending the great
and ancient plants of the Vaasa that they have become accustomed to the
slow pace of life, having time to consider without rash action.


@yRacial Relations:@n
After long association with the elves of the Vaasa, ents consider them
good friends.

Somewhere in the past ents and halfling met and each seem to share
stories about the other race and consider each other good folk.  Ents
find great amusement in watching the apparantly hasty, but good-natured
doings of halflings.

Ents deal fairly with gnomes and dwarves as they are usually known to serve
the forces of light and goodness, though ents tend to readily admit they do
not understand these ground-dwelling races.  Even while ents recognize that
dwarves are a generally goodly people they are quite cautious and sometimes
even mistrusting of a race with such a propensity for axes.

Ents deal with humans and lizardfolk fairly as well and more frequently
than gnomes and dwarves.  Most often humans and lizardfolk are dealt with
on a case by case basis as both races seem to fall squarely in the middle
of the matter of light versus dark.

Being a race that so whole-heartedly accepted the tenets of light, ents
typically abhor any race that serves the dark (goblins, orcs, ogres,
trolls and vyans) and would be hard-pressed to come to simple terms with
one who professed to have a goodly nature.  In time, perhaps, a member of
the dark races could prove themselves to an ent, but far too frequently
such tactics have been little more than ploys to wreak more havoc upon
ents or elves.

"Essyn"
"Essyn, Wind Maiden, is goddess of Air, summer, and the plains of the realm. 
There are no recorded instances of her appearing in corporeal form, though she
has been known to show her favor in any strength of wind.  A particular
favorite method of hers is to produce a wind that levitates an object without
disturbing it as a sign of her favor.  She also employs this tactic to help
guide her followers, on the rare occasions she does.  Othertimes, a blue-white
glow is the only sign of her presence.  Ancient texts tell of her passage
leaving a solitary white-blue feather.

Preferring to remain neutral in the aspects of the gods, Essyn is remote and
rarely has contact with them other than her fellow elemental gods.  Essyn
rarely offers comment on any question, so that this particular issue is not
addressed is perfectly within her character.

The Wind Maiden's symbol has two forms...  one is a swirl of wind in blue on a
white background, and the older symbol is the blue-white feather on a blue
background.

"Expressions"
"Expressions in acodes, mprogs, and oprogs use a syntax that resembles the C
programming language.  Specifically, each expression consists of one or more
@eterms@n, concatenated with @eoperators@n.

@eTERMS@n

A term can be any of the following:

@Ivariable name
@I@Ii, ch, room, etc., see @ehelp variables@n.
@Iconstant value
@I@Ispell name, player race, skill name, etc.
@Icharacter string
@I@I\"literal string\", #data_name.
@Ifunction call
@I@Ifunction_name( arguments )
@Inon-negative decimal integer
@I@I0, 1, 536, etc.
@Inon-negative hexadecimal integer
@I@I0xff, 0xabcd1234, 0XFEDC, etc.
@Ia dice-roll specification
@I@I2d10, 5d3+2, etc.
@I( <expression> )

A term that evaluates to an integer value (literal integer, integer variable
like \"i\", function that returns an integer) may be preceded with '-', thus
negating its value.  Alternately, any term may be preceded by '!', which
performs a logical negation.  '~' performs bitwise negation.

For all bitwise operators, assume integers are 32-bit variables.  For
arithmetic operators, overflow from positive to negative occurs when an
integer is incremented past (2^31)-1.

@eOPERATORS@n

Multiple terms in an expression are separated by operators, which are listed
below in order of decreasing precedence.  Operators listed on the same line
have equal precedence, and are evaluated from left to right in the expression.

@I*, /, %         : integer multiply, divide, remainder.
@I+, -            : integer add, subtract
@I<<, >>          : bitwise left shift, right shift
@I<, >, <=, >=    : integer comparison
@I==, !=          : equals, not equals
@I\\&              : bitwise AND
@I\\^              : bitwise XOR (exclusive-or)
@I\\|              : bitwise OR
@I&&              : logical AND
@I||              : logical OR

Note that the expression \"short circuiting\" behavior of languages like C is
performed for the \"&&\" and \"||\" operators.  If the left-side term evaluates to
false (for \"&&\") or true (for \"||\"), the right-hand term is never evaluated.

For example, depending on the value of \"i\", the attack() function might not
get called in the following statements:

if( i == 1 && attack( mob, victim, 1d8, +raking claws\" ) ) { ... }
if( i == 1 || attack( mob, victim, 1d8, +raking claws\" ) ) { ... }

"@eFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ)@n

@CQ:@n Why do auction/mail daemons not make change?
@YA:@n They prefer shiny silver coins and therefore will not accept copper, gold,
or platinum coins.

@CQ:@n Why won't the portal send me to <town name>?
@YA:@n There are three different portal rooms you may find yourself in.  None of
the portals will send you to every town.

@CQ:@n Why isn't there a high pkill or pkill count in score?
@YA:@n Pkill isn't supposed to be a goal on this mud, just an option for those who
wish to role-play a particular hatred.

@CQ:@n What does 'only-good-evil' mean when identifying an object?
@YA:@n It translates to 'anti-neutral-but-only-on-the-good-evil axis.'

@CQ:@n Why does 2.mob attack me even though I only ever was in combat with 1.mob?
@YA:@n Mobs which assist each other will share lists of those who have attacked
them.  Once you leave a mob around which is aggressive to you and its friends
enter the room with it, all of these mobs will be aggressive to you.

@CQ:@n I was hidden or camouflaged, and a mob I never fought could see me, and
attacked!
@YA:@n This is caused by the same enemy-list sharing described above.  A mob you
previously attacked, but allowed to survive, told another mob that you're in
the area.  Wary of your presence, the second mob won't be fooled by your
attempts at hiding or camouflage.

@CQ:@n Another player is stealing my zone!  Why isn't he being prevented or
punished?
@YA:@n Zone-stealing (a.k.a. area-stealing) is not against any rule on TFE.  Part
of learning to play here and advancing in the TFE world consists of learning
how to get along and deal with other players, who are sometimes difficult,
petty, or cruel.  None of these things is against any rule we have.

@CQ:@n Is piety implemented? How about fame? Reputations?
@YA:@n Quit bugging me and read \"help MUD Status\".

@CQ:@n Using a social, I can ruffle a lizardman's hair--but lizardmen don't have
hair!  Ha!
@YA:@n Socials exist only for roleplaying.  It's up to you to use them as you
like...  you could just as easily use an emote to \"ruffle\" the lizardman's
hair, or \"twiddle\" a human's non-existent tail.  If you feel the social
doesn't do what you want, don't use it.

banned delmair and all his other names for being caught multi-ing
and killing mobs for his other self
 
Banned Feilong (yet another mercury.whatever.sg player) for logging on as
Sasani, dropping all of his equipment on Swiftie (a friend), then logging
on as Feilong and getting the equipment from Swiftie.  I asked him if he
realized that was against the rules and he began arguing.  He said he

I saw no reason to refrain from banning him.

couple of minutes later when he thought no one was looking.  Logged out
again when I showed up.  When he came back the third time, I banned the
account.  2-14-97. <Kreel>

Banned account of Author-Ax.  Renamed him twice in 5 minutes and returned
to waste yet more of my and Kreel's time.  Kaos 

Celar had problem with pkill, was evil and killed.  Was informed I would
be right there, when I was not quick enough, Celar promptly gossiped a
quite inappropriate statement.  I deducted half Celar's gsp_points and
warned them not to do it again.  Set Celar to alignment neutral so he'd
leave off about pkill.  Please don't switch him to anything else now 
   
Requem/Lorst is from Chebutco banned sight.  Ban was lifted so he can

to the character, tell him no.  If he begins causing trouble, he was
warned..  if he gets banned, he gets no more chances.
   
Watch out for Goldust and Feilong.  Feilong asked Terek a question, then
went link dead.  He logged on a moment later, then Goldust told Terek

The familiar must be attracted by a specific type of symbolic focus, and vary
based upon the mage's alignment.
 
Familiars are not always as strong as many pets, but the mage has the
ability to view and act through it's eyes, making them good scouts.
can also be used to get into small areas.  Also, some familiars are
highly magical, and bestow magical abilities upon their master, when with
them.  
 
To switch into your famliar, the command is @Gswitch@n.  To return to
your body, the command is @Greturn@n.
 
Possible familiars for good-aligned mages are: ulannu jays, giant white
rabbits, white cats, fades, white riding horses, woodworm adults, war
dogs, mother eagles, white stags, and motes.  Neutral mages may bond with
moose, giant brown rabbits, tabby cats, brown bears, grey wolves, riding
horses, psuedo-dragons, giant preying mantises, adult white-tailed
eagles, and stags.  Evil-aligned mages may choose from twisted foxes,
wasps, bone bears, twisted wolves, black riding horses, screech owls,
mountain lions, giant bats, rabid dogs, or ornacs.  By the time a mage
reaches the level of being able to find their perfect familiar, they

"Forage"
"@eSYNTAX@n

forage

@eDESCRIPTION@n

Rangers use the forage skill to search for food or reagents in the wild.  The
kinds of items they can find depend on the terrain in which they search. 
However, rangers can't expect to stumble across fine china heaping with
freshly-cooked gourmet fare; sustenance culled from the wilderness tends to be
small, flavorless, and in some cases, downright disgusting.  However, it is
preferable to starvation.

@eEXTRANEOUS INFORMATION@n

Forage is a skill that does not use energy points to utilize it.  Spells such
as create food have a built in limitation based on energy consumption that
prevent them from being an infinite source of items and, as such, a person
must rest to regain energy before recasting.  Non-energy based skills such as
forage have no such built in limitation.  As such a limitation has been
included.  Forage is area-based and if you forage too often in a area you will
not be able to find anything else in that area until such time as the \"area\"
has \"rested\" to allow more foragable items to proliferate.  While this makes
forage area-based it has been decided that forage will still only work in
rooms of an appropriate nature to find items.  That is to say, you still can't
forage woodland items on a road paved through the middle of the woods.

"Freylia, Lifebringer, Harvestmistress, Mother of Halflings, is goddess of

directly, she appears as matronly halfling woman, golden-tressed and crowned
in wheat.  Her eyes are the color of earth, and she is clad in greens and
golds, the color of growing crops and harvest-time.  The garments are richly
embroidered, as if for a festival

As the goddess of harvests, Freylia has a close relationship with the
elemental gods, as they govern the crop cycle and the earth.  She is firmly
allied with Lonil and the Gods of Light, believing in peace and harmony and
that in war and destruction, the fields are first to be burned.  She is a
good-natured soul, quick to laugh and always ready to dance at a festival, it
is rare to see Freylia and have her not be smiling.  She is quick to defend
the fields and her people, and as such has given her halflings the ability to
be staunch fighters for causes they believe in, though also enjoying of the
simple things in life.

Freylia's symbol is her crown of wheat.

Freylia accepts worshippers of any good or neutral alignment, though she
prefers those with stout hearts filled with Light.  She is most often

This game is a role-playing adventure.  In it, you will experience many
joys, adventures, perils, and quite possibly face death.  We have worked
hard to convey to you our image of this world, and ask that in your
decision to join it you take a few things into consideration.  

First, in this world, it behooves you to chose a character style and 
follow it throughout your lifespan - people do not recognize you by name,
and must therefore become familiar with your style of speech and manner of
of actions. The setting of this game is a parallel universe to ours in a
time equivalent to our Dark Ages.

Second, we emphasize realism in this game.  This means that times are
quite tough for all players.  There are thieves and murderers, corrupt
guards and officials, and demonic cults.  By the same token, however,
there are an equal number of valiant knights and their vassals, holy
clerics, and wise mages.  Beware to treat all in such a manner that you
wish to be treated, and do not be gracious with trust - trust should be
earned, not given.

"Third, we have a policy which states that the immortals of this mud shall
not interfere in player disputes. Should you and a fellow player find
yourselves at odds, then find an appropriate means to deal with it. Ask
a passerby to moderate your discussion, ignore each other, have it out in
battle, start a war between your clans, etc. Perhaps you may even wish to
pray to your chosen deity for guidance.

Fourth, much adventure lies in the completion of campaigns. You will be
required to complete numerous campaigns throughout your lifespan here. It
is our policy that players not share information regarding campaigns with
other players. We actively enforce this by modifying campaigns on a per-
character basis, so that no two campaigns are ever exactly the same.

Additionally, we are working on an extensive faction system, whereby
players are brought into the game belonging to no faction, and may be
recruited into a faction once playing.  The factions will have a loosely
defined power structure which will will be as volatile as the members of
the faction.  It is not uncommon for a faction leader to be unseated by a
an underling, nor is it unheard of to find that two factions have merged
to become more powerful.  Factions are both tools of strategic importance
and means of safety for their members.  Take great care in your
decisions.

As the religions may change in the near future, at least until someone is set

        females about 3'4\" - 4'4\"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blond and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black.
      large pupils centered in large irises surrounded by white.

Affiliation: gnomes are a light race.

Appearance: Gnomes are shorter than humans, typically more slender than
halflings, and less broad than a dwarf.  Though gnomish skin tones run
through all normal human ranges, they tend more frequently toward duskier
hues.
Gnomes frequently have large facial features that stand out by human
standards.  Large noses or ears and, of course, their big eyes, making
them look a bit unusual by human standards.  Gnomes are typically not
what a human would term cute, though there are plenty of gnomes that do
look very much like simple, short humans.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Gnome@n

Gnomes are considered to be small, industrious workers and are known to
produce excellent spell-casters.  In temperament they are indeed
industrious as well as curious.  They tend to have an innate curiosity
about how things work and want to disassemble, study and reassemble
anything that can be taken apart, fixed or improved.  It is this
curiosity, coupled with their tendency to study the most minute details
to death, that has lead to the fame of many a gnome wizard or inventor.

Gnomes are most comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in
a small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.  In the
past, most gnomes lived around their great underground city of Orlumber
and conducted trade with humans in both Pennan and Narak and the dwarves
of Kha-da.  Since the destruction of Orlumber by vyans the gnomes have
moved to wherever they manage to feel comfortable.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Sharing a number of traits with them, gnomes tend to get along best with
dwarves and mix well in settings suited to both races, though not without the
occasional misunderstanding or cross-cultural problem.

To gnomes, the elves are a complete mystery.  Elven behavior is
considered inexplicable, mystifying and frustrating to most gnomes. 
Their most redeeming quality is the fact that they typically serve the
light, and thus, oppose those races that most often like to prey on
gnomes.

Gnomes have an even less positive contact with vyans, the dark elves, who
in past times have appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the
works of the gnomes (including Orlumber).

Orcs, ogres, trolls and goblins come just behind vyans on the gnomes'
list of least favorite peoples.  Gnomes have a particular distaste for
goblins and categorically deny all claims that there is any similarity
between the two races.

Much like elves, gnomes are hard-pressed to understand the motives of
lizardfolk thus the dealings between the two races are infrequent and
cautious.

Having insinuated themselves into human culture, gnomes have managed to
come to an easy peace with most humans and deal well with them.  After
all, humans travel wide and far and often manage to bring back
information and interesting things that gnomes just love to study.

"Goblins"
"@GAverage Statistics for Goblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6\" - 4'4\"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      When they do have hair it is usually black or brown and is
      usually caked in muck and filth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are usually
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown, reddish brown, or a muddy-amber color.  The iris 
      extends to the edge of the eye with a pupil that dilates between
      a pinprick in size to large circle as lighting permits.

Affiliation: goblins are a dark race.

Appearance: goblins have wrinkled, craggy skin or smooth, greasy skin in
colors of greens and browns or patchy/mottled earth tone mixes.  Though
they have fewer warts and protuberances than orcs, ogres and trolls, they
are not completely free of them as a race.  Goblins tend to have sharp
teeth, though they are small and would not be called fangs by any
stretch of the imagination.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Goblin@n

Goblins are a tough and wily breed known for their extreme tolerance of
situations that would drive out most other races.  Their resistance to
disease and infection as well as their tendency to reproduce in great
numbers make them about as impossible to be rid of as cockroaches.  Most
often the truth of the matter is that the larger races goblins hang
around are better at digging out tunnels and caves and cast off more than
ample resources to provide goblins with all they need to survive. 
Unfortunately for the larger races this means that the goblins also have
free time to explore and be a general nuisance.

Goblins really could care less about wasting time on hygiene and actually
enjoy the feel of cool, slimy muck squishing between toes, fingers and
any other joint.  Their greatest joys in life are exploring everywhere,
everything, and gathering as many things as they can.  To most other
races this comes across as intrusion and theft, however, the goblins seem
to be one of the few peoples who truly understand and are happy with the
rule stating that possession is 9/10ths of the law.

Though goblins have pervaded everywhere there are generally only two
varieties to be found.  The more common is the typical small, smelly
green goblin.  The rarer white goblin is found only in the northern Cairn
mountains and have a tendency to be a bit larger and more organized than
their smaller cousins.  Though more organized, the white goblins seem to
be more like small orcs and tend to make poor spell casters.  Of the two
varieties, green goblins tend to make the better thieves and explorers
while white goblins tend to make better warriors and know how to dig in
and occupy an area.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Goblins are a very communal people and love to chatter away at each
other, though much of the conversation usually consists of \"mine, mine,
mine!\" 

Trolls and ogres are considered dangerous and insufferable because they
tend to use their superior size and strength to boss around the goblins. 
The only thing that makes being near them tolerable is the sheer amount
of useful goods they leave just lying around or cast off.

Orcs as bad as ogres and trolls, only what they lack in comparative
strength they make up for in organization and intellect.  Fortunately any
goblin can point out just why goblins are still the superior intelligence
of the four races.

Goblins will avoid dwarves when possible due to a long-standing dwarven
crusade to destroy all goblins.  Unfortunately they are all too good at
that task as goblins have learned.  Dwarves are the goblins most hated of
all races and any jab they can inflict on the race is worth getting in.

Elves are almost as bad as dwarves, though if it has been amply
demonstrated that if you leave them alone they will usually leave you
alone.

Vyans are an odd lot and, for those interested in attempting to wheedle
it out of them, are an excellent source one can learn magic from. 
Everything an elf could be is brought forth in what the vyans are. 
Unfortunately it also comes at the price of more insufferably bullying,
and with their swords and magic the vyans are quick to back up any
threats.  Still, they make excellent allies.

Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to goblins who figure that somehow the
races must be related, with gnomes the lesser relation in need of goblin
help, of course.  Why gnomes can't seem to learn to take orders and
continue to associate with races like dwarves is a source of constant
frustration to the goblins who would desperately like a new ally (or,
better yet, someone they could actually bully around).

Humans are a source of never-ending amazement, so long as you don't hang
out with the goody-goody ones that just want to kill you.  They build
dwellings almost everywhere, travel more than any other race and return
with so many neat things for goblins to appropriate.  Not to mention they
make the most amusing faces when they are forced to deal with goblins.

Halflings, as far as goblins are concerned, are just another race of
humans only shorter and more likely to be easier to boss around. 
Unfortunately they aren't quite as productive when it comes to
travelling and acquiring new things for goblins to appropriate.

Ents are a bit of a mystery.  They may look a bit like trolls but they
are neither as blatantly hostile nor as pleasing to the eye.  No slime,
no warts, and their skin almost looks more like bark than the nice
texture common to trolls.  Fortunately they do have the most interesting
responses when you uproot small plants or set larger ones on fire.

"greater animation"
"Calling upon the casters greater understanding of life and death and the means
by which corpses can be reanimated, this spell can be used to reanimate a
corpse with an even greater power.  The corpse's flesh will be burned away,
leaving behind a grisly skeleton that will be significantly more dangerous
than its zombie counterpart.  Like its lesser zombie form, it is slave to the
caster's will, remains under the casters control only so long as his or her
power infuses it, and it is unable to heal from its wounds.  This is an evil
spell, favored generally by those to whom involvement with the dead is no
great moral quandary.
  
All undead created in this fashion are chaotic evil.  Infer what you will.
Many civilized places will attack such undead on sight and whoever is with
them (meaning the creator and any group members) are likely to be considered
guilty by association and attacked as well.

"Gsp_guidelines"
"The purpose of this help file is to have a general guideline on hand to help
determine what is and is not considered unacceptable material and behavior
here.

Use of foul language or explicit content is acceptable in private between two
people (tells) to whatever extent they are comfortable.  The same goes for
clan channel chat.  If no one is complaining then consider it acceptable.

There should be a distinction between in-game content and out-of-game content.
The line can get a bit fuzzy so use your best judgement.  A person playing a
vyan who feels all other races are nothing more than dirt can be in-game
offensive all the want.  The moment they start persecuting specific players or
using real-world derogatories to insult people they have crossed the line.

I have been told we're not a PG-13 mud and we allow more things to occur.  To
me this means if one player calls another an ass on gossip or OOC then its not
enough to get them docked.  At most I can see us giving a warning if it
continues.

For example: Smith gossips: All orcs are assholes.

Given the standards I've been informed of, just stating this once isn't worth
even a warning.
If a second occurrence happens, a warning should occur first.
If the warning is ignored and it continues, let the docking begin.

Almost all players deserve a warning each time they start something.  If they
are repeat offenders and they're being problematic (ie doing it because they
know they'll always get warned) you can skip the warning.  If they're
problematic but have generally been behaving, a warning first is still the best
policy.

The above (about warnings) primarily applies to minor offenses.  If someone
lays in off the top with massively offensive stuff, real life racial slurring,
etc feel free to dock the appropriate amount the first time (see gsp_points,
declares 100 points) and removing the rest if they don't immediately stop.


@GDistinctions@n
Minor Foul Language: commonly heard swear words (damn, ass, fuck, etc) - 50 points
     ie: OOC god-damn I hate when that happens
     ie: OOC You asshole, stop talkin trash about my peeps
Major Foul Language: (I'm open to suggestions for specifics) - 100 points
     Real world hate mongering / Racial Slurring
       ie: OOC All [Insert Group] should die.
     Long strings of blatant profanity
       ie: OOC fuck you all, you god-damn mf bastards

Calling someone \"gay\" as a derogatory term.  Personally I'm quite offended by
this (I have quite a few \"gay\" friends) and would consider it a Major Foul
Language abuse.  Unfortunately I realize this is also common colloquial for a
lot of regions and we'll be fighting an uphill battle.  Perhaps this deserves
a warning the first time and a minor foul language offense the second?  Then
major?  I'm up for feedback on this since I'd easily just make it major on my
own.

There is also a distinction between transitory comments (something on OOC
which will scroll off and even out of OOC history soon enough) and someone
posting a note (or using title) to do something like this.  Notes and titles
are not transitory and get seen by everyone a long time or at least have the
potential too more so than chat channels do.  Violating the rules on a more
permanent forum such as this will double the penalties.

Bear in mind the target could be afk (some of our worst offenders have used
titles and they're people I've seen fall asleep at their keyboards for hours
using anti-void triggers so they don't even look particularly idle).  For
notes/titles, ask that they change it, wait, ask again (maybe dock 1 point to
get their attention and warn that they will be docked much more if they don't
respond), wait then start docking until they fix it.  If they just log off to
\"escape\" please post a note on the AV board (including succinctly the chain of
events and what you've done) so that another AV or Imm can handle them later.


Now, we all have words we find particularly offensive.  Bear in mind at all
times you are acting as a representative of the mud and not necessarily as a
person.  What sets you off may not set all people off and we have to treat it
as such.  If you can remain professional rather than personal about it, its a
lot easier to deal with people.  If someone starts pushing you buttons and you
realize you're getting personal about it (that is they stop using channels
inappropriately but are still arguing with you) try to get someone else to
deal with it rather then get drawn into an argument you're likely to hurt your
own reputation at.

Remember, as an AV, you're doing important work to keep the atmosphere of the
game consistent, fun, playable and appropriate.  If someone is abusing your
for that (ie sends you a tell stating \"Fuck You\") the moment you dock them you
have the right to dock them again.  If needed (they are a repeat offender,
commonly cause trouble, and you know they aren't likely to stop) feel free to
dock all their points and report them to an Imm to deal with.  An Imm can
validate your decision, put log notes about the trouble maker on their
account, and if necessary even reimburse docked points if the player deserves
some back.

"Gsp_points"
"Gossip points are a method to limit the amount a player uses the global
channels.  The desire for this is due to some players having a tendency to be
rather loquacious if not somehow muffled.  A player begins the game with a
small amount which slowly increases to a maximum of 1000 with time.  Using
various chatting features uses up these points.  The number of gossip points
your character has available is available via the @bscore@n command.

Use of chat or OOC: 1 gossip point
Use of atalk: 5 gossip points
Use of gossip: 10 gossip points
Use of shout: 500 gossip points

Avatars (AVs) and Immortals (Imms) can also dock your gossip points for
inappropriate use of chat channels.  The following are the suggested
guidelines but are not necessarily guaranteed:

Using the wrong channel (using atalk for chat, etc): warning
     After a warning, 25 points may be docked
Minor swearing on a public chat channel: 50 gossip points
Major swearing of use of derogatory terms (in a non-in-game manner):
     100 gossip points
Doing the same on a more permanent forum (notes, titles, etc) will double
     the docked amount.  Docking may occur multiple times until the offensive
     material has been removed.

Abusiveness to AVs or Imms doing their job may result in loss of all gossip
points, gaoling, or being banned temporarily or permanently from the game.
If you feel you have been dealt with unfairly by an AV or Imm you are welcome
(and quite possibly should) contact another AV or Imm however repeatedly doing
this just to get out of trouble will not be looked upon kindly.

legitimate (or semi-legitimate, at least) reason why they cannot move in
a direction - a rushing river, a steep cliff, a thick wall of brambles,
*something*.  In any case, avoid long awkward paths - these will become
deathtraps once pkill is in.

@bAnachronisms@n - Anything which undermines the illusion of this world
should be avoided.  Cutsey jokes may be funny the first time, but after a
while they lose their humor and just detract from the roleplaying
environment.  Jokes that are in-character are better than good, but
comments about real life are out of place and time and therefore
inappropriate.

@bItem Resets@n - Do not reset items of any significant value on the 
floor of rooms.  Even if guarded, eventually someone will be able to kill
the mob, quit, wait for repop, and repeat the process over and over to
get multiples of the item.

@bOriginality@n - No ripping off others' ideas.  Period.  We want all
original ideas, and while we're operating within a genre which owes a lot
to certain sources, let's not parrot back what's already been done.  Be
inspired by something, but take it somewhere new.  'Nuff said.

@bShopkeepers@n - These should be HIGH level, and have a summon function
with at least a 50% chance of summon each turn.  They should be able to
see invisible, detect hidden, and be resistant to poison and sleep in
order to foil players' constant attempts at larceny.  Armor shops should
not reset  above studded leather, with the exception of banded armor
in Kha-Da, and weapons shops' stocks should be comprised of bronze
weapons, with a few bits of iron and NO steel or + weapons.  This is an
adventure game, not an excursion to the mall.  Good items should be rare
and found in out-of-the way places, thereby giving incentive for players
to explore and take risks to get them.

@bProprietary Items@n - Certain items can only be found in certain places
in certain areas, and players have to go on a mini-search for them.  Be
careful not to reset such items elsewhere.  Before you reset an item,
make sure you know where else it is found, and whether your reset would
undercut a previously designed area.  When in doubt, post on the imm
board.

@bRepair levels@n - set these on items.  Make them > 3 unless you want
players repairing the item once the repair skill is implemented.

"Halflings"
"@GAverage Statistics for Halflings@n

Height: males about 3'2\" - 4'
        females about 3'2\" - 3'10\"

Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blond or red, rarely black.
      Facial hair is rare at best.

Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.

Affiliation: Halflings are a light race.

Appearance: Halflings look quite like human children until they reach
maturity.  They do develop wrinkles, graying hair and other human attributes,
only they retain their shorter stature.  Halflings most often develop a stout
build, some say due to the minimum of 5 meals a day they tend to enjoy as
opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend.  For those with prior role
playing experience; halflings are not hobbits.  We aren't going to ban you for
having hairy feet, but realize, it is not the norm.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Halfling@n

Halflings are typically good natured, care-free folk who are more interested
in settling down and enjoying life rather than adventuring.  Since the idea of
the game is to adventure, this means you are most probably playing a halfling
that is not quite that normal.  A normal \"adventuring\" halfling is one who
still values the good things in life: good meals, good company, and cheerful
surroundings.  Halflings are so steeped in the realm of light and goodness
that they tend to brighten any place they can go with a desire to bring simple
goodness with them.

The ideal adventure for your typical non-adventuring halfling would be
settling down with friends in a nice tavern to tell tales and discuss
adventures while sharing food and drink.  Your average adventuring halfling,
while finding the same pursuit equally exciting, tends to want to go see these
places for themselves as well as talk about them.

@yRacial Relations:@n

Halflings, though typically shy around non-halflings, are found quite
frequently among dwarven and human settlements having insinuated
themselves quite merrily into both cultures.

Halflings tend to view elves with some awe, seeing in them their goodness
and ethereal beauty.  The fact that elves treat halflings as cheerful
little icons of goodness doesn't hurt either.

Halflings tend to very much dislike vyans.  They view the vyans as the fallen,
evil forms of the elves they hold in awe.  To the halflings the vyans
represent a deep evil made more insidious by its nature to hide behind the
same ethereal beauty that graces the elves.

Gnomes are viewed as distant cousins as many of the same living
environments have been shared over time and few quarrels have resulted
over it.

Halflings detest goblins and orcs, the former race being nothing more
than a disruptive nuisance and the latter treating them no better than
they tend to treat goblin slaves.  Confrontations between these races
tends to be short and bloody.

Ogres tend to avoid halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large,
slow ogres.

Halflings tend to avoid trolls, as they look like a nice feast to most
trolls.

Lizardfolk are viewed with as a curiosity, halflings having rare contact
with them and no basis for understanding the culture at all.

"Hierarchy of the Gods"
"In the beginning, there were the three.  Algesa and Ulthi, the balancing
forces of law and chaos, and Meriada, the eternal.  The three crafted the
universe and into it brought the four elemental forces to craft the world,
Essyn the Air, Kantos the Earth, Kryoth the Fire, and Osse the Water.  The
world was chaotic, a sphere of pure elemental power running loose without law
or reason.

Ulthi flourished in this chaos, but Algesa and Meriada sought to bring order
to this new world.  They created the Ancients to tame the world and as they
did so, Ulthi grew anger at the power that was stolen from him.  He became
jealous and twisted and evil, the first evil ever to enter the universe.  Ever
Ulthi's balancing counterpart, Algesa became the first force of good in the
universe.

There were five original ancients, Taranth, Kerog, Lonil, Temohpab, and
Neughlen.  Taranth brought peace into the world, calming the elements.  Lonil
brought light into the world, creating the sun.  Temohpab tamed the darkness,
calming all of the dark places Lonil could not reach.  Kerog protected the
order from falling back into chaos.  Neughlen was responsible for creating
life to populate the world.

Things did not continue so perfectly for long.  The unity of the Ancients was
broken first when Ulthi corrupted Temohpab.

Together, Taranth and Kerog had three daughters, Tarafas, the Dawn Star,
Tarayla, the Evening Star, and Anor, the Child-Goddess.  Together, Tarafas and
Tarayla created the elves.  As told in @YThe Twins@n, their unity was broken
by Temohpab, causing Tarafas to leave the world and Tarayla became Shantara,
allying with Temohpab and baring him three children, Morr, Morkith, and
Xiroce.  As told in @YThe Child-Goddess@n, Anor's innocence was lost at the
same time.  Anor fell in love with Lonil and bore two children, Ashallan and
Slen.

Meanwhile, Neughlen mated with three of the four elementals.  She bore Duroth
to Kantos, Sst'rasa to Osse, and Freylia to Essyn.  Duroth, with affinity with
the earth, created the dwarves and gnomes.  Sst'rasa, with affinity with the
scaled creatures of the land and sea, created the lizardfolk, though he
designed them to live on land to escape Osse's control.  Freylia, saddened by
the loss of her child friend Anor, created the childlike Thenne, later known
as halflings.

The three brothers, Morr, Morkith, and Xiroce were among the youngest of the
Ancients, with the same level of power as the tricksters, Ashallan and Slen,
until they caught the attention of the original three.  Meriada chose Morr to
control the threshold between life and death.  Xiroce was chosen by Algesa to
watch over the afterlife and every creature to pass through Morr's hands. 
Ulthi chose Morkith and imbued him with the power to hold the dead in the
world and bring forth demons from other dimensions.

Cynnis, daughter of Tarafas, returned to the world to watch over her mother's
forests.  Ashallan and Slen were divided by an arguement that has never been
settled, Ashallan joining Temohpab while Slen remained with her father.  With
the quiet influence of Ulthi, Neughlen gained a fascination with mixing the
attributes of different creatures to make new ones and creating smaller and
smaller life forms of great power, creating the first diseases and all kinds
of terrible monsters.  This brought strife between Neughlen and her three
children, especially Duroth and Freylia, as Neughlen swore allegiance to
Temohpab.

@GOptional Advice for Role Playing a Human@n

This is basically the essence of role playing in a nutshell.  You created
your character, gave them form with statistics (the numbers that define
your strength and wisdom, dexterity and heartiness), and determined what
your occupation in this life will be.  Now it is time to breathe life
into this character.  Not just by stepping forth and killing anything
that gets in your way (though if you choose to do this is certainly
your choice), but by figuring out what this persona you've created is
like.
Are they exactly like you?  Or are they braver or more timid than you? 
What is their favorite food?  What do they like to do when they aren't
saving the world from the invading forces of darkness (or wreaking havoc
upon the weak-minded fools if you are evil).  Think of all these things
and what your character would be like if you met them.  Now try and
portray these things by your actions and words.
Want to impress someone with your role playing savvy?  Don't just walk up
and say \"lets go kill some ants\", unless of course you already know them
and are in a hurry, rather consider what you might really do.  If you ran
into a total stranger in the real world dressed as a priest, would you
greet him/her the same way you would greet a total stranger wearing a
full military outfit?  Would you just walk up to a complete stranger in a
nun's habit and say \"Hey, want to go shoot some hoops at the local gym\"? 
(If you answered yes to either of these, you might wish to seek
counseling).  In most cases the answer should be no.  Neither would most
characters do that.  How would you're character handle the situation? 
That's the basic essence of role playing.
Create not just a character, but a personality to go with it.  Then take
that personality and play it.  Do it consistently and you'll find
situations begin to arise that you have to muddle through and you'll see
your character evolving.
Now, if you're just looking for a good hack-and-slash environment we can
offer that too.  Just head right out and find the nearest things to kill. 
I'd advise using the consider command frequently in either case.  Its
also a pretty bad idea to start killing townsfolk as the guards in town
are a bit touchy about that sort of thing.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Humans have perhaps the greatest chance to meet and greet all the races
as a race for they, among all the races present on TFE have the greatest
variance of alignment and tendency to be good or evil.

Humans get along best with halflings and gnomes having shared close
living space with them for some time.

Humans get along fairly well with dwarves and lizardfolk, though do not
profess to understand them overly well as both other races are relatively
secluded from the human perspective.

Humans and elves only recently developed a stable relationship, having
been at war off and on in the past.  Many humans still distrust the elves
owing to so many years of ambushes, raids, and general mistrust that
developed throughout a war that very nearly destroyed the largest human
settlement, Medienne.  Throughout all this there have always been other
humans willing to trust the elves for their ethereal beauty and grace
that seems to set them above humans, even as others found these traits
alien and frightening.

Ents are considered a curiosity, sought by many as few are rarely seen. 
Soon after humans tend to lose interest in ents finding their slow,
deliberate ways too drawn out for their tastes.

Humans have peculiar dealings with orcs, with most contact between the
races occurring through dealing of a very mercenary nature.  Orcs aren't
the most cohesive of races and humans have had to deal with dozens of
various orc tribes whose only constant factor has been a tendency towards
brutish strength and barbaric vulgarity from a human perspective. 
Despite these social faux pas, orcs have been considered both allies and
enemies from time to time.

Likewise, humans have had similar dealings with ogres.  While ogres are
typically considered more dangerous and more predictable only because you
can only count on two things (that an ogre will be bigger than you are
and more disagreeable) humans have, on occasion, hired ogres as guards or
workers when their appetites for violence and food can be sated.

Humans tend to avoid trolls and goblins, finding the former race too
ready to eat humans regardless of how you handle them and the latter
race too capricious and filthy to be trusted.  In either case the races
are best avoided or pushed elsewhere to let others deal with them.

Vyans, primarily because they look so much like elves, are treated with
the same cautiousness if at all.  Typically only humans steeped in the
darker aspects of evil culture have any dealing at all with vyans.  Those
humans that lean towards the light not only distrust the vyans for their
elf-like appearance, but more so for the utter acts of evil purported to
be their doings.

"Orb"
"Imm Policies"
"@eCommon Sense@n
If you are reading this, you should know intuitively what you should and
should not do.  No dispensing of untoward favors, giving out items,
information, using your immortal status to help others, etc.  If you have
a question about whether you may or may not do something *ask beforehand*.

@ePlayer Assistance@n 
Player assistance is only to be given by Imms level 94 and over.  Imms
below 94 should keep player interaction at a minimum, and try to remain
invis to players.  Apprentices (level 92) should always remain invisible,
and should have no interaction save in emergency situations.  Those
qualified to do approvals may do so should no avatars be present.

Player assistance is only allowed for players at or lower than level 2. 
The types of assistance you may give are: giving food or drink when they
are starving or thirsty, removing the plague, sending them to a safe town
if they have locked themselves in a very aggressive area, etc.  You may
NOT load equipment for the player or give him items other than the basic
necessities for his problem.

@ePlayer Reimbursement@n
Player reimbursement can only be given by Imms level 93 or higher.  No
reimbursments may be given to players whom an imm knows in real life. 
Player reimbursements are only given if they lost their equipment
directly due to a MUD bug.  They will only be reimbursed for equipment in
their backup files.  Backups are made every couple days, so they could
have lost equipment that they gained in the last day or two.  At the same
time, they might gain equipment that broke in battle, etc.  We do not
reimburse due to crashes or lag.  Equipment on corpses 'created'
immediately before crashes will reappear on the body when the mud returns.

@ePlayer Renaming@n
All imms and avatars may politely ask players to change their names.  If
a player insists on keeping it, only a level 93 or higher may force him
to change it.

Players are asked to pick names that fit both their character and the
medieval time period.  If the player's name does not meet these
requirements, we will politely ask them to pick a more fitting name.
If a player is below level 3, only insist that they change the name if it
is extremely offensive or inappropriate.  i.e.  Dickhead or Mickey Mouse 
Otherwise, let the player experience the mud for a couple of levels.  If
he stays to level 3, then politely ask him to change his name.

The same type of interaction applies to interactions regarding player
approvals.  Players who are not responsive to avatar requests should be
referred to a high level immortal.

@ePenalties@n
Penalties for violation of policies are as follows: 

1st time:  warning, level loss, possible purge
2nd time:  automatic level loss, possible purge
3rd time:  automatic purge

Punishment is at the discretion of the senior Imms.

@eImmortal Identities@n
If you play a mortal, keep things separate.  Do @eNOT@n give out your
identity, and let players find out that character X is played by an
immortal.  Fairness is critical for the mud, and any appearance of
favoritism or impropriety is damaging.  Extremely so.  This cannot be
emphasized too much.  (Also remember that you are an imm first now and a
player second.) 

@eArea Design@n
Before an area can be created, it must be approved by the architect.  Please
send her a description of the area, why it exists, what types of mobs
will be there, etc.  If it doesn't have a rationale don't waste your time
building.  Themes are important.

@eArea Opening@n
Before an area can be opened it must be checked by at least one other .
Send a request for review to the arcitect

@ePlayer Interaction@n
As previously stated, apprentices (level 92's) do not exist as far as
players are concerned.  All other imms may be visible at their own
discretion.  They are expected to be courteous to all mortals, but should
provide no assistance other then that described above.  Immortals should
not load ANY items for mortals, no matter how innocuous, except during bug
reimbursements as described above.  Immortals obviously should not join
clans or participate in other mortal activities.  Participation in OOC
activities should be limited to keep immortals from seeming too mortal. 
This type of interaction, of course, may be done by mortal alternates.

@eImmortal Knowledge@n
Immortals are expected not to use their powers to gain knowledge
useful in day-to-day playing.  Area authors are expected not to take
leadership roles in groups in their own areas, so as not to reveal any
secrets.  Those immortals who, through the course of routine work, become
privy to information not available to players, are required to keep this
to themselves.  Those abusing their powers will be dealt with by Severus.

@eImmortal Account and Alts@n
Your mortal alts should all be on the same account as your immortal
character.  If you have alts currently on different accounts, send mail to
Severus and he will change their accounts to yours.

a2) Not to be given horribly unclear hints.
a3) To be able to win without the experience of past lives
a4) To be able to win without knowledge of future events
a5) Not to have the game closed off without warning, i.e.  no one way
dead ends 
a6) Not to need to do unlikely things
a7) Not to need to do boring things for the sake of it , i.e.  lets make
sense 
a8) Not to have to type exactly the right verb
a9) To be allowed reasonable synonyms
a10) To have reasonable freedom of action
a11) Not to have to depend on luck
a12) To be able to understand a problem once it is solved
a13) Not to be given too many red herrings 
a14) To have a good reason why something is impossible
a15) Not to need to be American to understand hints
a16) To know how the game is getting on

Temohpab would enjoy more despoiling a pure goddess than one already of

not be the same as the @yaffect skill@n, which is what affects the bard upon
playing, but it can be.  Null caster for the do_spell is necessary so it will
not create a leech, instead it wears off in time like bard songs.  @yLVL@n
affects how long the song will last before wearing off.  Look at the @yaffect

best the bard could do through normal magic.  Opdata @gaff@n tells the caster
who is affected by the song.  It is only necessary for spells that do indicate
its activation on their own.  Example: detect magic.  Modify_mana makes the

"Intelligence"
"Intelligence is one of the five basic character stats (Strength,
Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, and Constitution).

Intelligence determines how many spells you may cast before needing to
rest, as well as how fast your spell energy regenerates.  Along with
wisdom, intelligence also affects the rate at which you can absorb and
improve new skills.

Intelligence is an important stat for spellcasters, such as mages and
clerics.  It is also important to rangers and paladins who wish to be
able to wield a large repository of spells.

This function makes it easier to check a mob's race against a number of sub-
categories.

Say, for example, that you want to check whether a mob is a rodent.
You can try this:

if( race( mob ) == rodent ) { ... }

This works fine for your garden-variety squirrels, chipmunks, and ferrets, but
then you might notice that rabbits are of race \"rabbit\", and rats have race
\"rat\".  So, you modify your code as follows:

if( race( mob ) == rodent
    || race( mob ) == rabbit
    || race( mob ) == rat ) { ... }

This works OK, but what are you going to do when someone adds a new rodent
race without telling you?  Your code won't work.  Furthermore, what if you
want to check for even larger categories, like mammals?  Are you going to
write a great big \"or\" statement for 30 or so races?

Luckily, the \"race\" table is organized as a rough tree.  Each race has a
\"family\", which is the next-more-general race.  The is_family function
traverses this tree to see whether your critter belongs to the specified uber-
race.

So, to detect a rodent:

if( is_family( mob, rodent ) ) { ... }

or a mammal:

if( is_family( mob, mammal ) ) { ... }

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Removes an object from the game.

The \"number\" argument is optional, but care must be taken when omitting it. 
If it's zero or omitted, the number of objects deleted depends on how many
were \"selected\" by the event which called the acode, mprog, or oprog.
For many triggers, this number will be 1.

This may sound straightworward, but it's not.  For example, consider the \"get\"
trigger, assuming there are 5 apples in the room, and the player types \"get
3*apple\".

If the apple has a \"get\" trigger, the number \"selected\" could be 1, 2, or 3,
because there are many reasons the first 3 apples might not be combined into a
single data object in memory, even if they are all the same object type. 
However, if some of the apples *are* combined, the trigger will only be called
once for the combined object.  Moreover, the \"selected\" count may be fewer
than the total number of combined objects.

So, normal usage is junk_obj( obj, 1 ).

"Kantos-rev"
"Kantos, Lord of the Earth, is the elemental god of earth.  He controls the
earth all creatures walk upon and the mountains of the realm.  He occasionally
appears as a human male in the winter of his life with brown eyes, clad in
shades of brown.

Kantos is one of the four elemental gods along with @CEssyn@n, @CKryoth@n, and @COsse@n.
When the world was created, Kantos made the base to which the other elementals
added their powers.  @CDuroth@n, the dwarven god, is the son of Kantos and
@CNeughlen@n.  As with all the elemental gods, Kantos has no involvement in the
war between light and dark.

Followers of Kantos may be of any alignment, so long as they respect the
earth.  His holy symbol is a brown triangle, point up, inscribed in a circle.

"Kerog"
"Kerog, the Red Wind, is God of Battle, Tactics, and War.  Appearing most often
as a red, misty haze over a battlefield, Kerog is wherever blades are drawn to
fight and kill.  The red mist is most often whipped up into a furious wind
that whistles in the ears of the combatants, but they cannot feel.  It is
scented of oil, leather, and the coppery tang of blood.  When coalescing into
a form, Kerog appears most often as a mysterious figure in crimson plate,
carrying a bastard sword and a shield.  The plate is completely unadorned, as
is the shield.  Documented reports are also found of Kerog appearing as an
auburn-haired human man, with red eyes and a ruddy complexion.  His voice is
calm, but strong as steel.  His warhorse, Celadiran, always appears as a red
stallion, though the shade varies from russet to bloody crimson.

Kerog has declared to all his followers that no blade or hand may be raised to
a follower of Taranth.  No explanation has ever been offered, nor has any
violation been tolerated.  He is foe to Morkith, having fought the Undying
once over harm the demon did to the Lady of Peace.  The Red Wind has not
chosen sides among the Light and Dark Gods, preferring instead to be the force
of battle between them.

Kerog's symbol is a red bastard sword, point down.  It is unadorned and
functional.

The Red Wind accepts followers of any alignment, though he is honored by every
warrior and fighter across the realms.  There is an order of monks dedicated
to the way of Kerog, and they are called the Blood Wind.  They believe in the
perfection of the body as the ultimate weapon of war.

whirls into a furious storm, whistling about the combatants but they cannot

"Kryoth"
"Kryoth, Lady of Fire, is goddess of Fire, autumn, and the deserts of the
realm.  In rare writings is a physical form mentioned of her, and it is
usually that of a wraith-like form of fire.  Kryoth most often shows her favor
by flames that burn but do not consume, changing or growing foliage to trees
in the shades of autumn, or a hot, dry desert wind.

Kryoth takes as her own the element of Fire, the season of autumn, and the
searing deserts of the realm.  The brilliant, blazing hues of the trees during
the fall are said to be her touch upon the land, consuming the summer in its
flames, before yielding to winter.  She is a mercurial goddess, ever-changing,
flickering, much like her chosen element.  Her wrath is said to be frightful,
but slow to gather.  She counts no deities as her enemies, being more detached
from such human emotions, preferring instead to just be.

Kryoth's symbol is a stylized flame, often in shades of amber or crimson.

The Lady of Fire accepts only those who are willing to follow the cleansing
flame of fire.  As such, many of her priests are also gifted in the art of
fire magic.

@Glist@n        : lists all objects a shopkeeper has to sell 
@Glist@n <item> : lists items matching argument

@CDESCRIPTION@n

@I List gives you a table of all the objects a shopkeeper has, and their
respective costs, levels, number, and condition.  The cost is always
listed in copper pieces, and is based on the @Evalue@n of the object and
how many are in stock.  The level is the minimum level needed to use the
object, and is often low, although the more powerful items tend to have
high levels.

@I The number is the amount of a particular item that the shopkeeper
currently has.  As it varies, the amount that the item is sold for varies
as well; the more items he has, the less they will cost, and the less
items he has, the more they will cost.

@I The condition tells the status of the object.  A @Eshop@n always sells
items in excellent condition, unless an item in need of @Erepair@n has
been sold to it by a player.

@I If an argument is specified it uses the same input as buy so it can be
used to verify you are buying what you think you are.  Thus to see a list
of all shields in a shop you would use list all.shield.

@I*** in the level portion of the list means that either your race,
class, or alignment forbids your use of the item.

Example:

To list all gloves in the shopkeeper's stock:
list all.glove

"Lizardmen"
"@GAverage Statistics for Lizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6\" - 6'2\"

Hair: (you're kidding right?) Lizardfolk don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptilian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Affiliation: neutral

Appearance: Lacking hair for a description, lizardfolk often employ the
description of various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the way a
snake's scales form interesting patterns, many lizardfolk also develop
patterns.  Most often patterns are recurrent in clan members and are the
primary identifying mark of a particular tribe, clan or familial group of
lizardfolk.  Lizardfolk skin/scales are typically soft and smooth like a
snakes, though wet, fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been
noted before as well.

Lizardfolk have sharp claws that sometimes make grasping and manipulation
a little difficult, but which prove quite useful in unarmed combat. 
Lizardfolk are also lacking lips and can not whistle and must improvise
when calling pets.

Lizardfolk, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid desert climates. 
Lizardmen are not serpentmen, there is a difference.


@GOption Advice for Role Playing Lizardfolk@n

Lizardfolk are typically a fierce yet contemplative people who are
withdrawn in dealings with any other race then their own.  They prefer
the solitude of their own kind whenever possible, but will work alongside
others in times of need.  Within almost every lizardperson a war is raged
at all times between the hot-headed violent nature of brute survival
against the contemplative wisdom of peace.  Most often it is the youths
who are the fighters and warriors of a tribe, their easy anger reigned in
by the wiser, older lizardfolk who act as elder guides.  It is with time
and age that true wisdom and peace are acquired, quenching the rage
within though never stilling the fierce strength that came with it.

Lizardfolk come from a tribal background where many small tribes fought
with each other over territory.  It was not until two tribes managed to
absorb many others and, after a fierce struggle, finally came to terms
with each other and joined as one large clan that their only city of
Sos-kul was built in the Kissk swamp.  Though most have formed into one
homogenized clan, the scale-markings that typically identified various
tribes and familial groups are still pretty pure and a developing caste
system indicates that they will remain distinguishing characteristics for
some time yet.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Lizardfolk are generally a reclusive race preferring to stick to their own
kind.  Despite their misgivings, however, they have come to find that
they can get along well with humans who share the same tendency towards
the balance of light and dark.

Though contact is quite sparse, nearly being on the other side of the
known world from lizardfolk, they do get along fairly well with gnomes
when contact does occur.

Lizardfolk do not get along very well with dwarves due to several
cross-cultural differences and misunderstandings despite the faith they
both place in gnomes.

Lizardfolk do not mix well with elves at all.  Some speculate that this
stems from a past misunderstanding of temporal importance while others
argue that the conflict's roots relate to religious matters.

Lizardfolk have even less tolerance of the elves dark cousins, the vyans. 
Several wars have been fought between vyans and lizardfolk in the past.

Similarly, Lizardfolk do not get along well with orcs, ogres or trolls. 
Continued raids on lizardfolk settlements by these peoples has resulted
in a strong hatred for these races by most lizardfolk.

Lizardfolk do not tolerate the presence of goblins, considering them
nothing more than useless vermin and thieves most notable for their theft
of lizardfolk eggs which they sell to vyans to be trained as slaves when
they hatch.

"Llewyrr"
"  The Llewyrr live in the Mighty Vaasa, which lies over a range of
mountains to the northeast of Medienna.  The Vaasa is the mightiest
forest known, and dwarfs all others in its size, age, and grandeur. 
Llewyrr tend to dress in forest colors and have straight hair running
from dark browns to blonds.  Elven eyes are always striking, and come in
more shades and varieties than even those of human.

.  The Llewyrr have come to have very distinct characteristics which have
come to depict them, and them only.  Their general attitude towards life
deviates from that of many others; they believe in the sacredness that
all things: elven, human, animal, plant, rock, or soil.  Only those who
kill or destroy out of reasons other than necessity of survival are
considered lessers.  Over the years, however, there has come to be a
large generalization that all races other than elven kill needlessly and
destroy nature, and so are lessers.  Several radical factions of Llewyrr
have been known to massacare humans and other nearby races for seemingly
no reason.

.  Often it is possible to tell the specific beliefs followed by a
Llewyrr by the beads woven into his or her hair.  This is definately not
true for all though, as many simply choose their own path to follow.

glee in the misfortunes around him.

infuriates the Dark Mistress by simply ignoring her.  There is no love lost

poser of the question the butt of many misfortunes to come.

"Lonil"
"Lonil, the Radiant One, is the god of good and light.  He appears to his
chosen most often as a brave young swordsman, the gold of the sun in his hair
and an ebullience filling his sky blue eyes.  He wears a shining suit of
platemail, the mithril always reflecting and amplifying the ambient light
about him.  This light is often just a soft white glow about him, but can be
intensified to damage his enemies at his whim.  It is said to be death to for
evil to look upon Lonil in wrath.  He bears a shield, enameled in white and
emblazoned with his symbol, the sun.

Lonil's followers are known throughout the realm as pure-hearted warriors, as
the light of the Radiant One purges all taints of evil from the souls of those
who seek to walk in his footsteps.  His disciples seek always to protect the
weak and abused, the poor and the innocent, their virtuous lifestyle earning
them a well deserved reputation of chivalry.  Always the followers of Lonil
strive to bathe even the darkest corners of the world in the glory of the
light, ridding the land of evil's shadow whenever possible.

Lonil is the epitome of good, which may override and supersede the law in the
eyes of his followers, especially when the law is foul and unnecessarily
cruel.  This puts him sometimes at odds with Algesa, but they are often united
against Ulthi, god of Chaos.  The Dark Gods view the Radiant One as their
tireless foe, one to be triumphed over in their quest for darkness.  The Ebon
Triumvirate has a peculiar relationship with Lonil, as Morkith and Xiroce both
hate everything he represents, the Light side of Morr gets along quite well
with Lonil, and many of that faith claim friendship with the followers of
Lonil.  The Dark followers of Morr, however, throw their lot in with the other
of the Three.  Temohpab, in particular, battles against Lonil, and reserves a
special honor (it is rumored) for a follower who has slain a Radiance.  The
Radiant One has countered that with increasing vigilance of the followers of
Light.  Followers of the Radiant One must be of good alignment, though all
light races may choose to follow him, humans are his most prevalent disciples.

Lonil accepts only those given to light as worshippers, and he especially
frowns upon thieves and other practitioners of evil arts.

Allowed worshipper alignments:  any good (LG, NG, CG)

"Mage"
"@IA mage is an individual whose intellectual curiousity leads him to ask
questions perhaps better left unconsidered.  Mages typically possess
tremendous mental abilities, and spend a great deal of time in research

feeble physical skills.  From their magical training, they learn the
mystical nature of the world around them, and having learned how to shape
this force, they bend the physical world around them to suit their whim
and will.

@IWhile mages tend to start slowly, they are important to any group
because they have such diverse effects.  Simple spells can create water,
food, and light, while more powerful spells can harness natural forces
into bolts of lightning and sheets of fire.  Protective spells, detection
spells, and spells to enhance physical abilities are all learned by a
mage, and with the additional unique and extremely useful @Espell@n of
@Efind@n @Efamiliar@n, a mage is indeed a powerful class.  Mages' spells
are adversely affected by metal, and the more metal a mage wears the more

the necessary gestures.  This can take from 1-5 turns.

For mages (and eventually other delvers in the mystical arts), the amount of
metal worn on one's body affects the casting cost of spells in terms of
energy.  This is due to how metal interferes with the magical fields and
forces necessary for the proper casting of spells.  If your spells suddenly

"@C@bSYNTAX@n

The mail function uses the standard editor commands to write letters.  See
@C@bhelp editor@n for the list and description of these.  In addition to the
standard editor commands, mail also uses:

mail                  : lists your received mail
mail #                : either displays that letter (if not editing),
                        inserts/deletes that line. (See help editor)
mail <subject>        : begins editing new letter with subject <subject>
mail new <subject>    : same as \"mail <subject>\"
mail send <name>      : sends the mail being edited to <name>
mail send self        : sends the mail being edited to yourself
mail delete           : erases the letter being edited
mail delete #         : erases that message
mail delete all       : deletes all mail messages
mail cc <name>        : sends a copy of mail being edited to <name>,
                        but you continue to edit it.
mail edit #           : copies the specified message to the mail buffer
mail title <subject>  : changes the subject of the message being edited
mail search <text>    : searches for <text> in your mailbox
mail preview          : shows what the message will look like when sent
  
@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Mail is used to send a message to a specific person.  You do not have to be
introduced to that person; only their name is required to send a letter.

To send a mail message to anyone but yourself, you will need a silver coin for
the delivery daemon.  You can send mail to yourself in order to record
information you may want to re-read later.  Often, the @ejournal@n is a better way
to accomplish this.

Using the TFE mail system to annoy or spam other players is prohibited, and
may result in docking of gossip points, or even banning.

See also: editor, note, tell, journal.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Marmor is used to assign armor to non-humanoid monsters.  Each mobile can have
up to 5 different body parts.  For every hit on the mobile the fight routine
rolls a number from 0 to 1000.  It starts on body part 1 - if the chance for
that part is greater or equal to the roll, the hit occurs on that body part. 
If not it then compares the roll to the chance for the next part.  Therefore
the last body part should always have a chance of 1000.  Ac is the armor value
for the body part - if a hit occurs on the given part, 0-Ac points of damage
are absorbed.  For humanoid monsters set mflag humanoid which causes a default
list of body parts to be used.
Body parts with two words looks much better than just one word.

Example: warty leg.  Don't make the area name too long.

"maturity"
"@eSYNTAX@n
mset adult <vnum>
mset maturity <time>

@eDESCRIPTION@n
The maturity and adult fields act to simulate a mob growing into an adult
version.  There is no hardcoded limitation on how many nested versions of
maturity you can have; for example, you can have a hatchling dragon, young
dragon, mature dragon, etc.  that all mature from each other.

The time set in maturity is roughly 25-75 seconds per 1 maturity, or a rough
time of 2500-7500 seconds of real time for a mob with 100 maturity.

@eEXAMPLES@n
See mob 2547 for an example of maturity use.

@eERRORS@n
The behavior for setting the adult field to itself is not defined and may not
work.  There is probably not a reason to do this, anyway.  Circular maturities
(where vnum 1 matures to vnum 2, which matures back to vnum 1) are allowed,
and should function just fine.

Certain flags will not be set when the new mob is swapped in.  An example of
this is a flying mob that matures into a non-flying mob will not fall due to
gravity, it will be treated as if it is still flying.

For this reason, it is recommended that your mobs have similar mflags.

"Measurements"
"This help file aims to help people understand methods of measurement.

Created 12 June 2001, Phule

In TFE, we measure vertically large things (height of walls, etc) in
@bcubits@n.  A cubit (more specifically the Roman cubit) is equal to
about 17.5 inches, or nearly 44.5 centimeters.  This is (very) roughly
1.5 feet, or half a meter.  Something a mile high is over 3600 cubits.  A
500 foot drop is (about) 340 cubits.  A 10,000 foot mountain is over 6800
cubits.

Distance is in the form of the @bpace@n.  A pace (more specifically the
Roman pace) is equal to a little more than 58 inches, or almost 148
centimeters.  This is (very) roughly 5 feet, or 1.5 meters.  In fact the
Romans defined their mile as 1000 paces (double-steps).  One of 'our'
miles is a little over 1000 paces (it was extended to 5280 feet to
accomodate easy division into furlongs...).

One might also measure distances in 'rides' (days of riding).

For smaller heights (such as a person), we use the term @bhands@n.
A hand is equal to 4 inches, or (roughly) 10 centimeters.
So a six-foot tall human is, in terms of hands, 18 hands tall.

For small measurements (such as the thickness of a swordblade, etc) we
use the roman @bdigit@n.  The digit is equivalent to (very nearly, at
least) 2 centimeters.  This is (roughly) 0.78 inches (hate to get
technical...).  So a digit is about the width of a finger; a decently
thick (and crude!) sword would be a digit at its thickest.

For weights, we have @bgrains@n.  A grain is 1/7000th of a pound.  That
is, 7000 grains make up a pound.  For larger weights, we use the
@bstone@n, which is 14 pounds, or about 6.35 kg.  So, a 200 pound human
would weight about 14 and a half stones (a little less, actually).  A
stone is 98K grains.  Pounds are acceptable units of weight as well.

I know it may take some time to get used to these measurements.  But it
really helps me to get 'into' the spirit of things when your entire
thinking gets different.

"Meriada, Goddess of Time and Neutrality, is also the goddess of the arcane. 
Appearing in visions as a silver-haired sage of great beauty and power,
Meriada rarely takes physical form upon the earth.  When she does, it is most
often as a magical creature turned inexplicably silver, with a preference
being shown for those that fly.  An argent glow of mystical energy is another
sign she uses of her presence and favor, as well as turning the hair of a
worshipper the color of molten silver.  Those born with hair naturally that
color are said to have her favor, and while they may not become worshippers,
they most often grow into great wielders of magic.

Preferring to remain entirely neutral in the war between the gods, Meriada has
allowed her arcane forces to be used by both at the cost that neither side
take direct action against her or magic itself.  Magic being the power it is,
it was not a difficult decision for either the Dark or Light side.  She has a
particularly close relationship with Kantos, as the earth and magic and
eternity are impossibly intertwined.  She sometimes is worried about the
struggle between the Dark and Light completely overturning the concept of
Balance, she continues to have faith in the necessary forces of the earth
somehow being protected from destruction.

Meriada's symbol is the constellation that bears her name, a pattern of 9
stars that scholars say is the Silver Phoenix.  An alternate symbol sometimes
used is the hourglass, filled with sands often depicted as silver.

Meriada accepts as followers only those whose spirits are infused with magic,
disallowing those whose talents are more mundane.

"Metals"
"@C@bMETALS OF THE REALM@n
  
@bCopper@n
A soft, abundant, easily mined metal, copper is cheapest coin of the
realm.
  
@bSilver@n
Soft and gleaming, silver is rarer and more valuable than copper.  One
piece of silver is worth ten pieces of copper.
 
@bGold@n
Most of the gold of the realm comes from the mines of the industrious
Dwarves of Kha-Da.  Gold is a rare, extremely heavy metal.  One piece of
gold equal ten pieces of silver.
 
@bPlatinum@n
Earlier finders of platinum condemned it as \"false silver\" and threw it
into the ocean.  They came to learn the value of the hard, light metal,
however.  Platinum is silver-white, is very rare, and quite expensive. 
One platinum piece equals ten pieces of gold.
  
@bBronze@n
Soft, malleable, and plentiful, bronze was the first metal used by
mortals for making weapons and armor.  The practice of using bronze has
not gone out of style, however, because bronze is inexpensive and easily
replaceable.  Bronze is usually impure, thus bronze weapons and armor are
inordinately heavy.  Also, because the metal is so soft, it tends to
blunt easily.  Bronze tends to be easy to enchant.
  
@bIron@n
A heavy, hard metal, iron is the most prominent material used in weapon
making.  It can be forged by even apprentice blacksmiths, and is abundant
enough to be relatively cheap.  Found deep in the earth, iron tends to be
impure, and is therefore heavy.  It does not blunt readily as bronze,
however, so consqeuently is ideal for armor and edged weapons.  Iron is
fairly easy to enchant.
  
@bSteel@n
Steel is iron which has been super-heated to boil out impurities. 
Extremely hard, steel is surprisingly light-weight.  Steel weapons will
keep their edges, and steel armor will not dent easily.  Because only
experienced blacksmiths can work with steel, it is quite expensive.  The
Dwarves generally claim to have discovered steel, as only their mighty
forges could have produced enough heat to draw steel from iron.  Steel is
very disruptive to mage spells, and it tends to resist enchantment.
  
@bElectrum@n
A rare alloy consisting of gold, silver and copper, electrum is
silver-gold in color, is lighter than gold, and is quite soft. 
Therefore, it tends not to last when forged into weapons and armor. 
However, ancient mages discovered that electrum is extremely receptive to
magic, so much so that it does not hinder a mage's spell-casting ability.
Purified electrum, suitable for spellcasters, often has a faint blue glow to
it - this is often amplified by enchantments that are weaved through it.
  
@bMithril@n
The process of creating mithril is one of the most guarded secrets of the
elves, whose ancients were said to have worn suits of enchanted mithril
chainmail.  However, though no outsiders know how to create mithril, many
know how to forge it.  Several master blacksmiths claim to have learned
the secret of shaping the incredibly hard, lighweight metal.  Mithril is
a bright, almost white, glimmering silver color.  Among metals, it is
second only to adamantite in hardness.  Unlike adamantite, however,
mithril is easier to enchant, although it does hinder a mage's spell
casting ability.
  
@bKrynite@n
Rumors abound concerning the origins of the strange, dark purple metal. 
The most popular of these rumors is that the metal came from an ancient
race of godlings, whose weapons of krynite sank into the ground of the
battlefield where they destroyed themselves in a terrifying war.
Whatever its origins, krynite is undoubtedly magic in nature.  All
krynite exudes a soft, pallid glow, which fades as the metal gets
fatigued.  However, because every pore of the metal is infused with
magic, it will always resist infusions of further energy, such as
enchantment.  Krynite will not interfere with a mage's spell casting
ability.  The metal is incredibly expensive, and so difficult to work
with that only a genius could ever hope to forge it.
  
@bAdamantite@n
Almost nothing is known about this rare, dull-gray metal.  It is said
that those who discovered and could forge the metal have all died. 
Another rumor holds that adamantite is so hard that it can be forged only
with the combination of a giant's strength and archmage's magic. 
Adamantite is second only to diamond in hardness.  A warrior's metal,
adamantite makes incalculably valuable weapons and armor.  It is
extremely difficult to enchant, and is, for mages, the most disruptive
material known.

@bTitanium@n
Little is known about this lustrous gray metal, only tales from elder master
weaponsmiths and armorers who praise its unrivaled strength and durability.
They claim that when the gods themselves were in mortal form, wielded weapons
and armor crafted out of this powerful metal.  Legend has it that only one
person truly knows the secret to harnessing titanium into usable form, but no
one seems to recall who that person is by name.

"Mob Configuration"
"This help file describes some non-obvious things you need to know when
creating mobs.


1. Flying mobs

Flying mobs are configured using the \"can_fly\" Act Mflag, and the \"fly\" Affect
Mflag.  The following lines describe what the various flag combinations mean:

!can_fly && !fly : player or mob, can't fly, always falls from air rooms.
can_fly && !fly : mob, flies only when necessary, will fall if stunned, slept, etc.
!can_fly && fly : player or mob, flies only when necessary, will never fall.
can_fly && fly : mob, always flying, will never fall.


2. Mobs and water

A mob's interaction with water is controlled by its \"swimming\" mskill level,
its \"water_breathing\" Act Mflag, and its \"water_walking\" mflag.

Definition: deep water is terrain underwater, river, or water.  It is also
terrain shallows for any mob smaller than size dog.

The water_walking flag (unlike the same affect cast on a player) will allow a
mob to leave or enter deep water.  This is useful, for example, for keeping
ducks in the pond south of chiiron...  the original TFE had it surrounded by
no_mob rooms instead.  It can also be used to prevent land animals that are
able to swim from crossing rivers when wandering.

(The water_walking affect on players acts like float, but only over water.  It
also prevents the player from swimming down into an underwater room.)

Mobs without the water_breathing affect flag will not voluntarily go
underwater, since they would drown.

Note that these mob aversions to movement are overcome when the mob becomes
someone's pet...  it will follow its leader anywhere.

Mobs with swimming mskill at zero cannot enter or leave a deep water room.

So, to create a mob that swims around the surface and never submerges, set its
swimming to nonzero, its water breathing to 0.  If you want it to be able to
leave the deep water, set its water_walking to 1.

        first) look at similar mobs and set to same level - ubj
hitdice : should equal level (check \"help standards\" )...fyi, hitdice 
          is the HP on a mob or player(damage player can take)
sex : use best judgement
clan : if mob is meant to be killed unlike human shopkeepers, townfolk
       or whomever, the they should not be set to secomber...i.e.,
       (if killing mob is considered murder in RL, set to secomber)
race : check similar mobs or use best judgement
size : use best judgement
weight : if left at 0, the default value is based on the mob's size,
  or its race and sex if it's of a player race.
  Change the value if you don't like the default.
alignment : usually if aggressive, set to evil (but not always...ubj)
mvdice : you don't need to set for a regular mob (horse or such...yes)
coins : look at similar mobs, most mobs won't give much (or any) coins
stats : compare to other mobs, ubj or ask another imm.
resistances : there is a help file, but compare to other mobs (or ubj)
long desc. : use your imagination (but don't make too long)
keywords : if you see unique words in long desc. add them here
main desc. : aim for at least 3 lines long...the longer the better :)
  Check your spelling when done! (mdesc spell)
mextras : mention them in the main desc so players will find them
  Check your spelling when done! (mdesc spell)

mflag sentinel : stay in room
mflag stay_area : if not sentinel, then have this flagged
mflag summonable : makes mob capable of being summoned by a fellow clan
                   member who has \"summon\" in their mpcode
mflag has_skel : determines whether the corpse is 'animate dead'-able
mflag wimpy : do you want it to flee during fight?
mflag can_tame : most mobs won't be tameable, ask upper imm.
mflag humanoid : if looks like human (else, see marmor)
mflag aggressive : will this mob attack player when they enter room...ubj
mflag warm_b : if you don't know, ask another immortal
mflag scavenger : can take food, money, treasure and other items from the room
mflag can_carry : mob has an inventory
mflag all others : use best judgement (don't go overboard on affects)

Use mflag to set all the \"Wear Flags\" that correspond to places the mob can
wear equipment.  If the mob is humanoid (see above) you don't need to do this.

marmor : see help file on it...
mskill : see help file on it...
mpcode : look at my \"help standards\" file...fyi, mpcode is the attack
         code the mob \"performs\" on players

"mobs_vs_players"
"Far too often we see notes on the bugs, general, and ideas board asking
why mob skills that mimic player skills are better than player skills, or
even demanding that the mobs be better balanced as they have better
skills than the players.
   
This extends to things such as...  My level 10 warrior can only have 2
attacks, so why can the mob I'm obviously better than have 3 attacks? 
...Why can this mage I'm fighting cast a fireball every round yet it take
me several rounds?  ...How can this mob cast lightning bolts at me and
manage to claw me twice at the same time?  ...How can this mob is using a
sword like a fighter, spin kicking me like a monk, and casting a fireball
at me like a mage?
   
Trust me, the mobs ARE balanced to the players.
     
The experience on a mob is automatically determined by several factors,
which include how much damage the mob generally does and how long it
lives.  This leaves only a few options open to us to keep the mobs of TFE
interesting to the players.
- Either we give every mob you come across the same types of armor the
players have, meaning almost everything would have a hodgepodge of +1,
and +2 armor with every slot filled with something.  This would greatly
devalue the cost of equipment and one of the things that we strive for is
to have value placed on valuable equipment, so this is not an option.
- Or we modify their attacks.  Even here a balance must be struck.
  
Since there must be higher lever, more powerful mobs for the more
experienced players to fight they must be able to do enough damage to
provide a threat to people wearing the kind of armor and defensive spells
our high level players use.  To this end TFE has a set of standards to
which the builders adhere when creating mobs.  When a mob is assigned its
level, the standards determine how much life the mob has as well as how
much damage it must have the capacity to deal.  To preserve the value of
equipment, and insure everyone isn't pulling Flaming Mithril Swords of
Death +3 off of the kobolds, this means we modify them and give them
special attacks.  Sometimes this means we will give them a few extra
attacks in the round with mundane weapons, or modify the damage so they
tend to be doing more damage with a mundane weapon then it normally deals. 
For all you know, they are just better trained to use it.
  
Spells...  Not every spell you see a mob cast is exactly what the players
have.  The damaging effects of spells are also a part of the damage
covered under our standards.  If a mob is able to cast a fireball every
round, faster than you, it is only doing the damage it is supposed to and
its experience reward will reflect that.  Perhaps they just cast it
differently and had a better teacher or perhaps they have a better inate
ability to focus magic.  Deal with it.
  
We do try to keep them sensible, but we can not apply the same rules to
the mobs that apply to the players.  Otherwise there would probably only
be a handful of mobs on the mud yielding over 5000 experience.  Even if
that seems like a lot to you now, it won't later.  Later on, when you
need a million exp, or even just a few hundred thousand, and you need to
be killing mobs that yield 10,000 or more exp at a time having mobs whose
skills and equipment are the same as players that yield only a 5000 exp
tops will seem quite boring.  How fun do you think it'd be to kill a
million rabbits over several hours and still not level?  So bear with us,
play, have fun...  But most of all enjoy it.
  
Shade and sweet water,
Talis

"Morkith"
"Morkith, the Undying, is one of the three gods of the Ebon Triumvirate.  He is
said to be formless, made entirely of darkness, though with eyes of balest
red.  His appearance is rare upon the mortal earth, though it could be that
none live to tell the tale.

They are each aspects of death, and Morkith claims for his own the demons
summoned from below and the unlife of the undead.  He desires the power of the
dying and the dead, and constantly wars against his brothers, Morr and
Xiroce.  He hates the Light and the gods that serve it, though he sees them
more as raw materials than the scourge his Lord, Temohpab does.  Morkith once
sought to slay Taranth, and take through her the life of the world.  Kerog
stepped in, and in the resultant fight, dealt Morkith a blow with his sword. 
As such, the two gods have been foes ever since.

His symbol is his lurid red eyes looking out of a field of black.

Morkith is worshipped mostly by solitary practitioners of the dark arts,
though whenever an undead is raised or a demon summoned, it requires his
permission.  He grants this permission even to non-followers, because he is
willing to use whoever it takes to further his goal.  Each creature raised is
one building block in his tower, one step closer to his goal to become sole
Lord of Death.

death, guiding them through the transition.  He is said to be a beatific
figure, with feathered wings and golden hair.  His eyes, however, are
completely black, without whites or iris.  This is referred to by his faithful
as the \"Ever-Seeing Eye,\" the Eye of Death that sees the moment of every
creature's passing.  He has many servants, also appearing as Angels of Death,
who go and collect the spirits at the moment of their dying.

Morr is the god of dying, that intrinsic moment of the spirit leaving the body
and life slipping away.  No creature can die without Morr or one of his Dark
Angels guiding them through the passage.  There are two branches of the
faithful of Morr -- usually referred to as the Light and Dark Morr.  The Light
clergy believe that death is a part of life, and should be met bravely and
with honor.  They tend to the sick and the dying, hoping to ease their last
moments and bring them calm.  The Dark clergy believe that with each creature
they send through the transition, their lord gains power.  So they are a cult
of foul assassins, prone to poison and many other ways of dealing a quick and
brutal death.  The two branches of clergy have been battling since their
inception.  There are some clergy who walk the middle path, neither seeking
out to help the dying or seeking out new creatures to slay, but these few
wanderers are regarded as strange by both branches.

Morr's symbol is a stylized representation of the Ever-Seeing Eye, a black,
pointed ellipse surrounded by a circle that does not touch it.

1-100%.  (See help reset for details on the dice columns.) 1% is to be used
for extremely good items, and is, as the number implies, extremely rare.  100%
is frowned upon because it creates too much clutter.  Remember that the more

will have to use mreset <#> -1 to remove the reroll bit from the second item. 
Otherwise, they will both pop in the same slot at the same time.

No checking is done on the object's position, or whether in reality the mob
would be able to wear the item.  For example, you could have a mob wearing a
sword on its legs.  Please use common sense.

If you wish to set flags on an item in mreset, you use: mreset <#> +<flag>.

mskill [<skill> [<level>]]

@eDESCRIPTION@n

To use this command you must first be @emedit@ning the mob.

With no arguments, this command lists all of a mob's skill levels.

With only a <skill> argument, this command displays the mob's skill level
for a particular skill.

With both arguments, changes a mob's skill level. Currently working:
- All weapon types (unarmed included)
- Climb.  Replaces can_climb flag.
- Swim.  Replaces can_swim flag.
- Shield block.
- Blind fighting.
- Stun (use sparingly, like the see.camoflage flag)
- All dodge skills (tumble, guard, parry, dodge, shadow dance, off-hand
parry).  (*)
- Power Strike
- Charge, backstab, assassinate, garrote (**)
- Critical Hit
- Death Strike (use sparingly, and with best judgement).
- Hide, sneak, camouflage.
- Trip.
- Eye gouge.
- Mounted fighting.
- Riposte.
- Meditate and trance.
- Escape.

These skills also work, but not automatically.  They need order, force,
an interpret() call, or they can be done while switched: 
- Pick lock.
- Inspect.
- Untrap.
- Appraise.
- Bandage.
- Riding.
- Berserk.
- Frenzy (must be berserking)
- Melee.
- Rescue.
Note that some of these (e.g.  Appraise) are generally useless unless
done by a switched mob, since only the mob sees the result.

(*) - Setting a mob to mksill of dodge 0 means they wont dodge.  Ever.
Mobs will never parry unless wielding a weapon.
(**) - Charge, backstab, and garrote are done using the attack_charge(),
attack_backstab(), and attack_garrote() functions.  These functions return 0
on a miss, or if the mob doesn't have a weapon.  The syntax is attack_charge(
mob, victim ), attack_backstab( mob, victim ), or attack_garrote( mob, victim
).

When adding mskills to mobs, with exception to the dodge skills, all mobs
should be the level of the skills you are setting them.  No level 10
monks will have critical hit.  This is not a mobs_vs_players thing, this
is a standards thing.

@B@b*@n Multiplaying is defined as having more than one character, both
controlled by the same real-life person, logged onto the MUD simultaneously
or within 5 minutes of each other.  You may create as many characters on your
account(s) as you like, but you may not multiplay them.

@B@b*@n Multiplaying is not allowed.  It gives too much of an advantage over
those who cannot do it.  It also promotes soloing and works against the social
structure of the MUD.
   
@B@b*@n Players may not trade equipment between their own characters, nor may
they assist others in doing so.  You may not create a new character and give
him equipment from an old character, even if you delete the old one.

@B@b*@n The Immortals of TFE insist that all players wait five minutes before
logging alternate characters on.  In addition, players may not log in and out
frequently in order to speed up area resets.  This also includes constant
voiding in areas.
   
@B@b*@n Each account may have only one character on at a time, and playing
multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted.  This rule
extends to equipment trading and the 5-minute rule as well...  even if you've
cleverly managed to create multiple accounts, characters in all your accounts
are subject to these rules, as if they were all under the same account.

"Its important to realize that we take names somewhat seriously here.  Your

atmosphere of the game.  If an Avatar (AV) or Immortal (Imm) ask you to change
your name to match policy, then you do have to change it even if you were
recently approved.

* First, the best names are medieval sounding or otherwise similar to a
  fantasy setting.
* Second, names must be names.  (Slasher, Mauler, Bashur, these aren't names)
* Nicknames are unlikely to be accepted.  (ie Slim, Baldy, Skippy)
* Please use common sense when creating names.

@RThe basic guidelines for unacceptable names are:@n

* Main characters largely identified with a specific well-known book, movie,
  cartoon, comic, anime or other media. (Bilbo, Akira, Mojo Jojo)
* Titles may not be included in names (Sir Peabody, Queen Ann)
* Names that are vulgar or offensive (you get the idea)
* Names or attributes of deities, angels, demons, or any other major figures
  in world religions (Jesus, Satan, Beelzebub, Buddha)
* Bastardizations of any of the above (Billbo, Sirknight, Mi-lafs)

Now, having read all that, its possible you may have noticed a few people with
names that may somewhat violate this list.  Some of those people are likely
pending a name change themselves.  Some others, however, are players who have
been playing for some time and these long-term players may well have been
grandfathered in and allowed to keep their name in deference to the time
they've played here.  Just because they were fortunate enough does not mean we
will ignore the rules entirely and it does not mean you can automatically keep
your name if it violates the policy.  In the event that a newly-trained AV
passes a name that shouldn't have been, as has happened once in a while,
another AV or an immortal may come along and have you change your name to meet
the naming policy.  Please don't argue, everyone makes mistakes and its our
job to fix them.

@c*****@n AVATAR AND IMMORTAL NOTES @c*****@n
@GMedieval Names:@n
We've asked both that people use medieval/fantasy names and that they don't
use names of primary characters from books.  Please bear in mind that most
people didn't live in medieval times so they aren't going to know obscure
medieval names.  Since most commonly known medieval names have either been
used as a main character in a book or are still in use today there is an
extreme problem with people finding \"acceptable\" names.  Use some common sense
when denying names.  The idea was to avoid Bilbos and Gandalfs but something
like Osric is fine, even though its used as a primary or secondary character
in multiple books.  By that token, something like Gandalf (an actual medieval
name) probably would be acceptable but we've denied it on the basis that
Tolkien's works are so prevalent and the fantasy name has taken precedence as
too common.

If someone wanted to use the name Fosco as a halfling I certainly wouldn't be
offended or find problem even though a little research shows that's one of
the hobbit names Tolkien used.  If anything, I'd quietly praise them for doing
a bit of research, picking a fantasy appropriate name, actually applying it to
the \"accepted\" race for it, and not having to resort to picking primary
character names.  If all else fails, even a common modern name (since many
have basis in older medieval names) should suffice.  Remember, we're here to
help guide people into the setting not dominate their wills and tell them how
to play.  Provided they aren't overtly ruining the game for others let them
play, we're all here to have fun.

@GOffensive Names:@n
If the name is offensive, Avatars and Immortals may either ask the player to
change the name, or they may disconnect the player entirely.  This decision
should be based on the degree of offensiveness and how reasonable the player
is.  Some people *do* log on for the sole purpose of causing trouble; these
people should be dealt with accordingly.

As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars alike should
politely ask for a name change.  If the player refuses, please talk to or mail
an immortal about the situation and encourage the player to do the same.  @cDO
NOT APPROVE@n a player whose name is inappropriate.

a name.  Also, it is best to avoid names based on verbs like Slasher, Mauler
or Killer.  Such names will only invite a name change.

Changing a single letter to make a minor difference is essentially the same as
using the donor name.  Klown will be treated in the same manner as Clown --
that is, it will be subject to a change.

Names obviously generated by reversing words or other names are unacceptable. 
Examples include Mrots, Teloiv, and Susej.  Interpretation of the \"obviously\"
qualifier is left to the discretion of the Avatars and Immortals.  Slightly
modifying the reversed word is also not acceptable.  The rule is that an
unacceptable name is also unacceptable if it is reversed.

@RMost importantly:@n If an Avatar asks you to change your name, it is assumed
they have a good reason and you should comply.  You may MUDmail Zithuan (read
\"help mail\") with questions or complaints.  All complaints will be
investigated and appropriate action taken.  However, please remember that
Avatars will be given the power to change your name immediately if it is
obscene or in direct violation of our naming policy in the game.  Just because
your name is allowed by one Avatar at the time of your approval doesn't mean
another Avatar won't recognize it from a book or movie, so be aware that you
may still be asked to think of an alternative name if the situation warrants. 
@RThere is no grandfather clause applicable if you are level 10 or below.@n
Players levels 11 or above who are in violation of the naming policies of the
game will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.


@RThe basic guidelines for unacceptable names are:@n

* Words from the dictionary or word-blends that don't make sense.  Who is
going to name their son Sheepkiller?  Answer: Nobody.  It's a nickname, not a
real name.
* Main characters from reasonably well-known books, movies, cartoons, comics,
anime or other media forms.  Examples of this are Bilbo, Akira or Mojo Jojo.
* Names of cities, countries, or worlds, both real or fictional.  Hershey
would be unacceptable, and so would Dune or Nashkel.
* Famous names or names strongly associated with a particular topic (Osama Bin
Laden, Curie, Oksana).
* Names including titles (Sir Peabody, Queen Ann).
* Major foreign words.  Major is defined as anything known to whoever is
around, but may well include things like Joie (\"joy\") or Cabeza (\"head\").
* Nicknames (names that depend upon the person you are now, or some physical
attribute (Lightfingers, Stubbytoes, One-eye).
* Bastardizations of any of the above (Frendz, Doonbuggy, Mi-lafs).
* Names of inanimate objects, particularly those that frequent the MUD (Tree,
Stone, Stream, Road).
* Names of real or mythical animals (Griffon, Lion, Bird, Eagle, Woodworm,
Bear).
* Names of famous people, real or fictional (Princess Leia, Cindy Crawford,
John Doe)
* Names that are vulgar or offensive (you get the idea).
* Names or attributes of deities, angels, demons, or any other major figures
in world religons (Jesus, Satan, Beelzebub, Buddha).
* Names of anachronistic or modern items, or items not found in a medieval
setting (Toothpaste, Shoepolish, Moonunit).
* Anything that requires an article (The Tick, Thetick, The Pope, A Killer, Da
Boss).
* Names based on actions (Slasher, Mauler, Killer, Basher)
* Names based on your occupation or race (Ranger Bob, Warrior Ted, Ima
Gobbi-Healer)
* Names that are variants of names that won't pass (Joanne Ark, Ghandalf)
* Names that are not names (Bignstupid, Jackofclubs, noname)
* Names based on combinations of above (BearMauler, Rat King, Joie d'Blade)

@c*****@n AVATAR AND IMMORTAL NOTES @c*****@n
If the name is offensive, Avatars and Immortals may either ask the player to
change the name, or they may disconnect the player entirely.  This decision
should be based on the degree of offensiveness and how reasonable the player
is.  Some people *do* log on for the sole purpose of causing trouble; these
people should be dealt with accordingly.

As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars alike should
politely ask for a name change.  If the player refuses, please talk to or mail
an immortal about the situation and encourage the player to do the same.  @cDO
NOT APPROVE@n a player whose name is inappropriate.

"Neughlen"
"Neughlen, the Sickness, is the chaotic goddess of the creation and twisting of
life.  She creates plagues and poisons of all kinds, also twisting far larger
creatures into new and dangerous monstrosities.  She appears as a twisted
monster made from the parts of many creatures, though when she appears to a
specific person she becomes a combination of what he loves and hates.

Neughlen is one of the Ancient Ones, akin to @CTaranth@n, @CKerog@n, @CLonil@n, and
@CTemohpab@n.  Neughlen was vested by @CUlthi@n with the power to create new life, and
when he embraced evil, she too fell into darkness.  She bore three children,
each to one of the elemental gods.  With @COsse@n she bore @CSst'rasa@n, with @CKantos@n
she bore @CDuroth@n, and with @CEssyn@n came @CFreylia@n.  Neughlen has since joined
@CTemohpab@n and the dark gods and her children have turned from her madness.

Neughlen's followers are usually chaotic in natures and often outcast by their
homelands, for they are known to bring disease and misfortune to those around
them.  For this reason there is no organized church of Neughlen and her
followers often disguise their worship, even using the holy symbols of other
gods with impunity.

"A neutral evil person is selfish and callous.  Unlike a lawful evil
individual, he doesn't care much for laws and rules and will just as likely
knife a bureaucrat as bribe him, but he lacks the rebellious streak that
typifies chaotic evil people and is never evil for evil's sake.  He's evil for
his own sake.  A neutral evil person is cold and calculating and thinks how
each decision can bring him profit or pleasure.

but when things go too far they are willing to take matters into their own
hands.  Many neutral good people become adventurers for this reason.  A

"New Continent Project"
"A new continent will begin construction once the Chiiron Farm, Hydras, and
Dark Chiiron are completed.  It will be a very large scale project, hopefully
with contributions by everyone, and I (Elfir) would like to think it'll be the
killing blow to all those other clones out there.  Enough gloating, here's the
plan so far:

1.  A boat will go from the Medienne docks to a small harbor at the
north-eastern edge of the new continent.  To ride the boat players will have
to either buy a ticket or stowaway, and stowaways will need hide or
invisibility to manage that.  The boat leaves at a certain time each day, not
when the players get on, unlike the fisherman at grems, and will travel for a
little while before reaching the other side.  This wait will not be painful
because there's an entire ship to explore and loot and an entire crew to talk
to.  I want people to realize that this place is far away.  Also encourages
them not to jump back and forth all the time.

2.  The harbor on the continent will be a very small town, with a trading
post, a bar, an inn, and fishermen.  At this point, only half, at most, of the
mobs are human.  Humans have not really settled here and just have this little
trade town as an attempt to profit off the place, but with little success.

3.  A vast plainsland spreads out south from the harbor, territory of a tribe
of nomadic halflings.  There are a few solitary wemics but it shouldn't be too
dangerous for a cautious level 10 to cross alone.  Areas are within and all
around this plainsland, most anything you can think of so long as it fits in
the plainsland ecosystem somewhat.  Enough of it should be mundane for it not
to look like a zoo.

4.  At the western border of the plains is a goblin farming village at the
base of a large mountain range.  The goblins are at perpetual war with the
halflings and on a cliff far above live perytons which pick off the strays on
both sides.

5.  Somewhere to the south of the plains is a very Neughlenish bog, full of
hybred monsters, strange disease, and all sorts of fun things.  Lots of room
for creative monsters in here.

6.  Along the eastern edge of the plains is a very large forest.  Somewhere
deep within is an old temple to Ulthi which caused many things to twist around
weirdly and chaos unbalances law.  There is an old castle in there, Euldemere,
whose denizens are all chaotic and have been for generations, a place so
chaotic it's lawful.

Each region needs to be built as well as areas within the regions, especially
the plains.  It should be less annoying to write the plains if we are instead
connecting many smaller sub-areas.  If you have an idea for something you want
to add, mail it to me and I'll help figure out how exactly it should fit into
the continent.  The final product should fit together like a puzzle, no oddly
placed areas and no weird themes out of the blue.

"@eDESCRIPTION@n

This is a checklist of things to consider when creating a new object.

* Are you copying from another object, or creating from scratch?

oedit new objectname or
oedit new oldvnum objectname

* Note the vnum - you'll be using this.

* Type oset and oflag for information about the object.

* Consider the type.  See 'help object types' for more detail on each of the
possible types your object can be.

* Consider the weight.  For weapons, see help 'weapon creation.' For other
objects, set it to the appropriate weight in pounds - look at other similar
objects for ideas.

* Does the object radiate light?  Set the light field if so.  This should
usually be 0.

* How much is the object worth?  This affects repair costs as well as sale
price.

* What level is the object?  This is important for scrolls/wands/potions as
well as weapons and armor.  See the standards files again.  You'll want to
check this last.

* You can specify a number of times a player must have remorted for a player
to use the item.  If you want the equipment to be remort-only, set remort >= 1.

* If the object can be repaired, set the repair difficulty down.  10 is
impossible.  Note that obscure materials make things hard to find craftsment
for, even if the repair difficulty is low.

* If the object can be melted for a metal it contains, set the ingots field. 
Most armor should be 1 ingot, breastplates or shields can have up to 3.  For
this to work, one of the metal material flags must be set.

* [?  If the object is a gem ?], and there are other objects which are
identical when unidentified, set the fake field to the vnum of the fake
object.  See obj 998 for an example.

* Set the type-specific fields.  For example, weapons can have the damage and
type set.  Gems have quality.  Wands have charges and spells.

* Set the object's appearance fields.
Prefix_S - adjective that goes before the single object name,
Singular - noun, name of the single object. if object has unidentified name, put that in {} beforehand.
Long_S - remainder of a sentence, displayed for a single object on the ground.
Prefix_P - plural version of Prefix_S
Plural - noun, name of object when stacked. Ditto for {}
Long_S - remainder of a sentence for when stack of objects is on ground.
Before - pre-identified modifier to object name.  by default displayed before
singular/plural, but if prefixed with +, displayed after.
After - post-identified modifier to object name.  by default displayed before
singular/plural, but if prefixed with +, displayed after.
[? You can only have a particular before/after modifier appear at the start or end of the noun, not both. ?]

Example:
Prefix_S: humming
Prefix_P: resonating
( one sword is humming but if I drop two at once, I'll see 'two resonating blades...' )

Singular: {blade} daiklaive
Plural: {blades} daiklaives
( one daiklaive, two daiklaives when identified. otherwise, blade/blades. )

Long_S: is stuck into the ground here.//
Long_P: are stuck together in the ground.//
( 'A humming blade of black metal is stuck in the ground here.'
'Two resonating soulsteel daiklaives are stuck together in the ground.' )

Before: +of black metal
After: soulsteel

* Write the object's description.  Use oextra new extraname to create it, and
odesc to edit one.  'either', 'before', and 'after' are special: use
before/after for objects that vary with identification, either for ones that
don't.  This is the desc when you 'look object.' For extra details, you can
include more extras - for example, make a 'hilt' oextra, and the player can
'look sword hilt.' Objects should have a sentence at least.

Check the spelling of all oextras; after you've finished writing them, but
while still editing them, type \"odesc spell\".

* Assign suitable size oflags. This only matters for wielded/worn objects.
- custom_fit: only wearable by the person who customs it
- size_specific: only wearable by sizes flagged - also set one or more of tiny
through giant.  Players are only small through large.
- random_size: chooses random size when created.  [?  from all possible sizes
?]
- race_specific: only wearable by races flagger - also set one or more races.

* Set affect flags.  These are affects that are granted when the object is
worn.  Be careful here - look at current objects that grant that affect, and
see the standards files.

* Set object flags.  See help 'object flags' for a list.  In particular,
usually set air_fall and water_sink/float.

* Set wear flags, if you want the object to be holdable/wearable.  Unset take
if you don't want players wandering off with it.

* Set layer flags, if the object can be worn.  See help 'wear locations' and
'layer' for info on what goes where.  If in doubt, base.

* Set anti flags.  Use judgement - warriors get good armor, mages don't.  See
standards.

* set restriction flags - bladed for stuff clerics can't use, dishonorable for
paladins, no_hide for glowing things, no_sneak for noisy things.

* Set material flags.  All objects should have at least one, and often
multiple.  An object with no materials can't be repaired.

* Set object affects - oset affect for a list.  For example, for a +dam item,
oset aff dam 1.  Be careful here.

* Write object codes using opedit.

* Set object level, with all your affects and toys.

* Load one, identify it, play with it, make sure it looks right.

Height: males about 6'6\" - 7'6\"

Hair: Browns, black, reds and rarely gray.
      It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear, nose, shoulder and back hair are quite common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors that are mainly
      shades of gray.  Sometimes they have hints of red or black as well.
      The Irises are large leaving only a thin margin of the sallow to gray
      surrounding it visible.

Appearance: Ogres are most often quite muscular with odd protuberances,
large warts and cysts most frequently, as well as having frequent patches
of hair-covered warts that can confuse their bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor postures and stoop horrendously.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky
shade of grey-brown, sandy-brown, or a ruddy red-brown but it is always
somewhat rubbery.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Ogre@n

As a general rule, ogres are big, mean and dumb.  They are typically
brutish and like to bash anything smaller them as much as possible.  They
particularly don't like little creatures, who tend to cause problems
and/or steal things.  The general attitude of life for an ogre is pretty
simple.  If you can eat it, do so.  If you don't plan on eating it, bully
it.  If you can't bully it, then smash it.

Ogres aren't known as great conversationalists, but they are the favored
workhorse of the dark armies being the best at what is most often called
for in any combat situation.  Smash, rend and tear into itty-bitty pieces.

Ogres have no real central governing force, nor do they care overly much
for family units.  Despite the lack of central cohesiveness, they still
managed to construct a city, Denab-Knur (The ogre words for Cave you live
in, further demonstrating their creative genius).  True to form, city
government is based on strength.  The strong rule and the weak serve.

Two varieties of ogre have evolved here.  Gray ogres tend to be the
stronger and dumber of the two.  Red Ogres, so called for the ruddy hue
of their rubbery skin, are somewhat smaller in stature and possess a
smidge more intelligence than grey ogres, they are still about as smart
as a rock by the standards of most other races.


@yRacial Relations:@n

As a rule ogres dislike anything small.  Halflings, gnomes, dwarves and
goblins are all treated with contempt and should be stomped on repeatedly. 
Goblins, at least, know how to tear things apart and can, on rare
occasion, be useful in breaking something in a small places ogres can't
reach.

Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty dumb even by ogre standards,
make for useful allies.

Orcs are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how to cut and
build things, though they obviously aren't as good as ogres or they
wouldn't be so puny.

Vyans make useful allies, as they make good diversions when hunting elves
and are good at dealing with elven magic.  Unfortunately they are also a
nuisance as they always seem to think they are in charge.  Fortunately
they rarely get in the way of such truly important matters as smashing
things when it comes time to do so.

Elves and lizardmen are hated simply as a matter of course.  They serve
no purpose but they do bleed exceedingly well once you get past all their
silly magic and sharp claws.

Humans are an odd lot.  While some are almost as good as orcs, many more
are often as bad as elves and lizardmen.  Though its usually just easier
to smash them the same as elves, sometimes it pays off to only smash them
a little.  Once they know who's boss, they make pretty good allies.

"olddwarves"
"Famous for deeds other than the invention of the braided beard and the
double-bladed axe, the Dwarves of the Forest's Edge are known to make
fine warriors and adventurers.  Strong and hardy, Dwarves also possess a
certain innate resistance to magic which makes members of this race
particularly valuable allies and extremely deadly foes.  The Dwarves of
Clan Khedrun make their home in the great underground city of Kha-Da, and

although they don't much like the annoying brightness which is the sun,
in typical fashion, Dwarves have learned to make do with sunlight, even
if it still irks them.

Dwarves have, in general, an undying hatred for several races - among
them Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and Ogres.  Above all, Dwarves cannot stand
Goblins, who to them are less than worthless thieves who should be buried
alive in the next collapsed tunnel.  Needless to say, Goblins conceive of
Dwarves in similar terms.  Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism,
at times bordering upon open contempt, and Vyans are perceived as a
particularly sinister threat.  Humans, on the whole, are seen as
unnecessarily volatile and a race which really hasn't finished
adolesence, grown up, and figured out what it wants to do with itself. 
Lizardmen are a bit of a boggle for Dwarves, while Gnomes are considered
to be the most agreeable, sensible of fellows, next to other dwarves, of
course.

"
There are two main races of Elves on the Forest's Edge, the llewyrr or
Eleint, and the Vyans, or Dark Elves.  See help @bVyan@n for information
about the Dark Elves.

The Eleint (or \"llewyrr\") make their home in the grand wood known as the
@bVaasa@n, and seek to rid the forest of evil creatures.  Due to the wood's
great size and the many perilous areas with which it borders, this is a
constant and neverending struggle.

The Eleint are known for their unique style of dress.  They generally
favor forest colors, ranging from deep green to soft browns.  Their hair
ranges from light blond to darkish brown and, rarely, black, with their
skin tone similarly varied.  Also, full-blooded eleint have no facial
hair.  Their hair is typically straight, and the Eleint are known to be
fond of weaving beads into their coifs which represent various aspects of
that particular individual's beliefs, background, family, etc.  The
Eleint typically stand 5' in height, sometimes a bit taller or shorter,
and are slender in girth.  Eye color is varied, with browns and blues
being the most common.

The Eleint have developed a substantial sense of group identity and
cohesion among themselves; some speculate that this is due to their
status as athe children of an 'elder' race, but this is unproven and an
issue of dispute among the greatest sages of the realm.  Nonetheless, the
Eleint are known for their respect given toward the natural world, with
all natural things considered to house a sacred spirit, be they elven,
animal, plant, rock, or soil.

Over the years, however, hard lessons have taught the surface elves to
mistrust outsiders.  Beyond their unmitigated @b@Rhatred@n for all Vyans,
the Eleint possess a healthy suspicion of many races, and have become
outright hostile to others.  Dwarves and Gnomes, though overly
materialistic and concerned with trivialities, are races whose level of
pollution has not yet progressed past their being saved.  Humans, for
their part, are considered to be intemperate and immoderate, prone to
acting first and considering the consequences of their actions later, and
substantial ill-feeling exists between the Eleint and Humans due to
several pastwars and untoward actions, on both sides.

Despite their misgivings with Humanity, the expediency of survival has
forced the Eleint to cooperate - begrudgingly - with humans in the face
of a greater threat.  Posing such a threat are Orcs, Trolls, Ogres, and
Goblins, who along with Vyans are considered as unnatural, twisted
abominations who should be wiped from existence, their very presence an
oozing, infected and diseased wound threatening to destroy the realm.
The Eleint will not associate with these races under any condition,

"oldent"
"Ents are large, sturdy, bipedal beings often mistaken at first glance as
being part of the landscape.  However, this @Rdoes not@n mean that they
ARE trees.  Their heads are very tall, and they have hardly any necks at
all.  Their arms are covered with smooth brown skins, and their large
feet have seven toes each.  They generally have long beards which are
bushy and twiggy.  Their tree-like nature makes them slow and ponderous,
though they are not at all sedentary.  Ents are strong and have excellent
constitutions, however, they are susceptible to the forces of nature,
most especially fire.
 
This ancient race's native tongue is very difficult for other races to
learn; but they quite easily have learned elvish.  Besides their natural
friendship with the forest-dwelling elves, ents are also very friendly
with gnomes and lizardfolks.  They have less understanding of the
underground dwelling dwarves, but are not openly hostile.  This good race
has troubles with all of the @Ydark@n races found in the world.

@CWith regard to an ent's appearance and description, keep in mind that
ent's are not trees.  An ent's appearance should reflect the fact that
he/she IS an ent.  While it is acceptable to compare ents with or ascribe
certain traits of trees to ents, neither the description nor the
appearance of an ent should state in any fashion that he/she IS a tree.

"oldgnomes"
"
Gnomes are known to be small, industrious, and excellent spell-casters. 
They are comfortable living in an underground city or burrow, or in a
small home on a rolling hill in some bucolic country setting.

In the past, the Gnomes, centered around their great underground city of
Orlumber, have conducted extensive trade with Humans in both Pennan and
Narak.  Sharing a number of traits with Dwarves, Gnomes tend to mix well
with these two races, though not without infrequent misunderstandings and
cross-cultural problems.  To Gnomes, the Eleint are an utter boggle,
their at times inexplicable behaviors utterly mystifying and frustrating
to the members of Clan Thorstag.  Needless to say, Gnomes have had even
less positive contact with the Dark Elves, who in past times have
appeared out of nowhere to ravage and destroy the works of the Gnomes. 
Gnomes tend to have their problems with other races.  Goblins, Orcs,
Ogres and Trolls are prominent on this list, as are Vyans.  Gnomes have a
particular dislike for goblins and categorically deny all goblin claims
that there is any similarity between the races.

"oldgoblins"
"Small, tough and wily, Goblins are known for being good at a lot of
things, with the general exception of magic.  Quick and hardy, goblins
make excellent thieves due to their generally high dexterity and small
stature, though persistent individuals have managed in the past to
succeed at a wide variety of careers, including magical ones.

Goblins @b@Rdespise@n daylight, dwarves, elves, and humans, and prefer to
torture and tease any creatures which they may come across.  They also
conceive of trolls and ogres as utterly insufferable, generally because,
like orcs, these races tend to use their superior size and strength to
bully goblins into doing what they don't want to do.  Goblins will not
associate with Dwarves, due to long-standing tensions and a bloody
history between the two races, nor do they particularly like Elves (of
any type).  Dwarves are viewed with outright hatred, due to their
continued butchery of innocent goblins over countless centuries.  \"The
only good part of a dwarf is his scalp\" states a common Goblin proverb. 
Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to Goblins, who figure that somehow the
two races must be related, with Gnomes of course the lesser relation in
need of help from Goblins.  Why Gnomes cannot learn to take orders and
continue to associate with other, evil races is a source of constant
frustration to Goblins, who would desperately like a new ally (or, even
better, someone they could actually bully).

Most often green, brown or some disgusting combination of mottled earth
tone in skin color, Goblins stand about 4' in height.  They hate light,
live far underground and prefer sharp, stabbing weapons and short, thick
bladed axes which are easy to swing in confined spaces.  Spears are also
a favored weapon.
 
There are generally two varieties of goblins: the generally small, and
more common, green goblins, and the white goblins, a rare variety of
northern goblins which have a tendency to being larger and less chaotic
in their organization.

"oldhalflings"
"

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n
@IHalflings are a race of 'little people.'  They are small, hearty, and
generally cheerful.  Being shy, they often live in small communities
hidden deep within a forest or tunneled far into a distant hillside.
Quick and dextrious, Halflings can move all but silently through nearly
any terrain.

Most Halflings live in their own communities, though they do trade heavily
with Humans and Dwarves.  Halflings are common in the Human cities, often
in taverns discussing adventure over a hearty mug of ale.  Halflings are
fascinated by Elves.  They consider them beautiful and mysterious, though
the Elves' strange customs are an utter cipher to the down-to-earth
Halflings.  Gnomes and Halflings have amicable, if distant, relations.
Goblins and Orcs are hated with a passion by Halflings and meetings
between them are usually short and bloody.  Trolls and Halflings, while
generally at odds, sometimes partner up for mutual benefit.  Ogres
generally avoid Halflings as the small race tends to annoy the large, slow
Ogres.

"oldhumans"
"The humans of The Forest's Edge are much like you or me in physical
appearance.  They are used as the benchmark for other races to measure
themselves against, and are known for being solid all-around in their
abilities and professional opportunities.

In the past, Humans have had extensive contact with Gnomes, and have
experienced generally strong relations with them, as much as any
generalization about two groups of such size.  Humans and Dwarves have
fairly strong ties on the whole, while relations between Humans and Elves
have been fairly volatile, as both sides have had trouble understanding
each others' intentions, leading to a series of misfortunes over the past
centuries.

Humans and Orcs do not get along well at all.  Ogres and Trolls are seen
in a similar light, though in the past Ogres have hired themselves out to
humans as mercenaries.  Goblins are viewed as capricious little
troublemakers who are best met with force so they leave humankind alone
and go bother the Dwarves.  Vyans have had very little contact with
humans, and even as Human-Eleint relations are touch-and-go, bordering on
the negative.  To Humans, the Eleint are a strange lot whos kidnappings
and ambushes of humans in the past, together with sometime cooperative
efforts, makes them seem, at best, a schizophrenic race.  Vyans, for
their part, are viewed with extreme suspicion, and in the past those
Vyans unfortunate to be caught by humans have sometimes been burned at
the stake as demons.  As a result, most Human-Vyan meetings tend to be
short andbloody.

"oldlizardmen"
"Lizardmen are strange specimens, being large, bipedal reptiles.  They are
strong and sturdy, but slightly lacking in intelligence and dexterity. 
When fighting bare-handed a lizardman does more damage than most due to
their sharp claws, which are large and powerful but do sometimes make
grasping and manipulation of fine objects or details a bit difficult. 
They are unable to whistle though so have to find other means to call
their pets, and sometimes have to find special gear to protect their
hands.

Lizardmen are a generally reclusive race, getting along best with those
of their own kind.  Despite their misgivings, they tend to get along well
with Gnomes and Humans, though they cannot brook Dwarves' behavior
despite the the faith placed in them by Gnomes.  Lizardmen do not mix
well with the Eleint; some speculate that this stems from a past. 
misunderstanding of temporal importance, while others argue that the
conflict's roots relate to religious matters, and the two races' loyalty
to deities with competing spheres of influence.  In any case, Lizardmen
like the Eleint's evil cousins even less, having fought a number of wars
against the Vyans in the past.  Similarly, continued raids upon Lizardman
settlements by Orcs, Ogres and Trolls have initated a hatred of these
races among Lizardmen; for their part, Goblins are despised due to their
theft and sale of lizardmen eggs to slaves, notably Vyans.
 
Lizardmen, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid, desert climates. 
Lizardmen are _not_ serpentmen.

"oldogres"
"As a general rule, Ogres are big, mean, and dumb.  They make wonderful
warriors but generally feeble wizards and clerics, due to their innate
tendencies towards high strength and constitution and low intelligence
and wisdom.  Their great size is often of use in combat as well, making
them excellent bashers.  Ogre mages and clerics, rare though they may be,
are not unknown to the realms.

Ogres frequently stand up to 7' in height, and weigh a great deal.  Their
skin is rubbery, and their eyes dull.  Ogres are famous for their great
appetites and fast metabolisms, their rates of regeneration being second
only to Trolls.

Ogres do not like little creatures, who tend to cause problems and/or
steal things.  If they cannot be bullied, they should be smashed.  Humans
can be a similar problem, and dwarves tend to show up at the worst times,
and also merit destruction.  Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty
dumb, make for useful allies, as do the fragile but cunning Vyans.  Orcs
are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how cut things,
while Elves and Lizardmen are hated as a matter of course.
 
There are generally two varieties of ogre: the grey ogre, and the red
ogre.  Grey ogres tend to be somewhat stronger, yet even more dim in the
brain, while red ogres are somewhat smaller, yet possess a fierce,
sinister intelligence.

"oldorcs"
"A bit slow and a bit dumb, Orcs are nevertheless know to be tough, wily
and strong foes worthy of one's respect.  Slightly larger than a human,
Orcs prefer the dark confines of underground caverns and the hidden
realms of the underworld to the light of day, and will emerge into
sunlight on only the dimest of days, if they can help it, and only after
expressing their dismay at having to suffer from 'that accursed
brightness.'

Orcs are known to be none too fond of Elves, particularly the Eleint,
whom to Orcs are only valued for their skins and teeth.  Orcs begrudingly
respect Vyans, due to their continual warfare with and mutual hatred
toward the Eleint.  Dwarves and Gnomes make excellent slaves, food, or
both.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres as well as Goblins, whom
they frequently like to bully (with varying amounts of success).  Orcs
and Trolls tend not to get along well at all, except when hunting the
accursed Eleint (Trolls being insufferable bullies).

Not the strongest spell-casters, Orcs are known to be excellent warriors
and thieves.  They have, however, been known to succeed in whatever
profession they might choose to pursue.
 
There are two basic varieties of orc: the eastern orc, and the western
orc.  The eastern orcs tend to be more chaotic and tribal, while the
western orcs are somewhat larger and more intelligent.

religions are based on the various gods in existance.  There are two
classes of conflict in our world: the struggle between @border@n and
@bchaos@n, and the struggle between @bgood@n and @bevil@n.  Not all
deities involve themselves in any one of these struggles, but most
concern at least one.  Some gods are only concerned with their own greed
for power, others strive for a balance in the grand conflicts.
 
The most powerful god is @EAlgesa@n, goddess of lawfulness.  Opposing her
is @EUlthi@n, god of chaos.

There is a second tier of gods whose power is not so broad as either
Ulthi or Algesa, but nonetheless have great power.

@ETaranth@n, goddess of charity.
@EKerog@n, god of fury.
@EMeriada@n, god of time and knowledge.
@EMorkith@n, god of the undead and demons.
@EFreylia@n, Halfling goddess of festivals and battle.

There also is a third tier of gods whose influence is
weak beyond their regions of control.

@ECynnis@n, goddess of the forest.
@EKantos@n, god of mountains and earth.
@EOsse@n, god of sea.

@I Outside the pale of these stands @EMorr@n, lord of death.  There is some
debate among scholars of the realm as to whether or not @EMorr@n is
really a god as he never recognizes his followers in life.  But his power
is great over the realm of the dead and so there are many who worship him.

@I In addition to these fairly encompassing deities, there are myriad
smaller ones, from half-demons worshipped by remote orc tribes, to the
elven goddess Dawnstar.  Other than Dawnstar, a few other lesser deities
of note: Lonil, god of valor; Slen, god of luck; Anor, goddess of love.
  
@I A few other deities of note: Orlumbin, Durgoroth.

"oldtrolls"
"Trolls are big and slow.  Make that @bBIG@n.  Known for their prowess in
battle, their superior physical attributes, and their great size, Trolls
are known to be unsurpassed warriors.  Along with these physical traits
comes a particular dimness of mind and of senses, and Trolls able to cast
spells are rare, and often less than competent.

Trolls' metabolisms are famous as well for their speed;
they regenerate much more quickly than other races, and consequently
must eat a great deal more to satiate their great stomachs.

As a thoroughly subterranean race, Trolls are adversely affected by
therays of the sun.  They rarely venture forth to see the light of day,
only doing so at night, or on those cloudy, dim days when the sun is at
its weakest.  Trolls fear fire, for its affects harm the race to a great
extent, and slows their recuperative capacities.

As citizens of the underground world [Note: now under construction],
Trolls live in loosely-organized clan bands which meet with other bands
(\"nations\") at regular intervals, holidays, etc.  Trolls generally get
along well with one another, and frequently associate with Ogres, as the
two races are frequently of like mind.  Trolls perceive Vyans as
untrustorthy schemers, though useful allies in dire circumstances. 
Goblins make useful servants, and Orcs often function as valueable allies
while hunting (and, they hope, skinning) the vile Eleint.

Like surface elves, Dwarves and Gnomes are intolerable and utterly
disgusting to Trolls.  Gnomes are utterly insufferable to Trolls, who
cannot understand their lack of appreciation for the fine art of mindless
destruction and cold, dark places.  Humans are a puzzle to trolls - some
make great allies and comrades in arms, while some are just as bad as the
worst Eleint.  The fact that humans have hunted trolls for body parts in
the past, along with gnomes, does nothing to improve relations.  Trolls
credit Elves with making a fine stew.
 
There are generally two varieties of troll: the southern, or swamp,
troll, and the northern, or ice, troll.

"oldvyans"
"The Vyans, or Dark Elves, live underground in their shadowed realm, far
from their hated cousins, the Eleint.  Long ago, the two clans (some
might say races) were one, but even this is cloaked in legend and rumor. 
Vyans can only barely stand the light of the sun, having since time
immemorial spent their days in the dark, sunless recesses of the earth,
*miles* from the Earth's surface.

Vyans and surface Elves possess an unmitigated hatred for one another, a
conflict whose origins are clouded in myth and rumor.  Known by surface
races as \"Dark Elves\", the Vyans return the suspicion and intolerance
shown then by Human, Gnome and Dwarf alike.  Similarly, while Vyans have
in the past cooperated with Ogres and even Trolls in times of crisis,
this is a race which is generally reclusive and suspicious - some might
say outright hostile - to outsiders.  Lizardmen are considered to be a
less developed race by Vyans, suitable only for enslavement and
indefinite servitude.  Just as Humans, Dwarves, Elves, and Gnomes have
tortured and slain those Vyan unfortunate enough to fall into their
hands, so too are the Vyan known for their merciless destruction of
prisoners of said races.  The Vyan neither asks for, nor gives, quarter.

Contrary to popular surface-dweller belief, Vyans are not all
dark-skinned and white-haired creatures.  Their skin tones do indeed
vary, from a dark midnight hue to a pale, wan color some say results from
untold ages spent beneath the earth's crust, far from the burning light
of day.  Slender in build, Vyans stand about 5-5'6\" in height.  Their
eyes are most often violet or even amber in hue, but albinos, as well as
other odd colors,reputedly occur among the Darkest Folk.

opset                      : shows the current action's stats
opset <field> <value>      : set action flags

@WPARAMETERS:@n

Fields that can be set are:

Trigger          : what triggers the acode being edited
Obj_Act          : set object vnum to be set to obj_act variable
Command          : used to set specific trigger commands
Target           : used to set specific targets of the Command Field

Using opset without a field will function in the same mannar as opstat.

Using opset <field> without a value will show all values available for that
field.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

The opset command is used to set the high level oprog values specific to the
object you are currently editing with oedit. Relevant help files for further
information include:
@Whelp oedit@n, @Whelp oset@n, @Whelp ostat@n, @Whelp oflag@n,
@Whelp opedit@n, @Whelp opcode@n, @Whelp opstat@n, and @Whelp oflag@n.

These values determine what triggers the opcode.  Not all the fields have to
be set. In fact, certain fields aren't even active or useful without other
fields being set correctly.

For example, oprogs set with a trigger value (usually) do not need the command
value filled.

Oprogs with the Trigger set to none can only be called from another opcode, or
when some combination of command, target and obj_act are also set.

Both the command and target fields can contain multiple options, separated by
spaces.  The Obj_Act field can contain one vnum of an object that will be used
in the processing of the opcode.

Note: The command and target fields follow the same basic rules followed in
acodes.  See @Whelp aset@n for more information.

@YDISREGARD PARAGRAPHS BELOW... OBJ_ACT IS NOT IMPLEMENTED@n

The Obj_Act field is used to check that an object is found with a matching
vnum.  The places the oprog searches are determined by the opflag command.  If
obj_act is set to some object class, and the \"target\" string is empty, and the
\"command\" string matches the user's command, the code will try to find an
object, matching the rest of the typed command string, in the room, inventory,
and worn on the player. (determined by flags set in opflag)

Note that this will consider options such as \"2.<object>\".

If the item is found, and it matches the type of object defined by Obj_Act,
the obj_act variable will be set and the oprog will be executed.  The \"obj\"
variable will be the object that the oprog is being called from, just as it is
currently.

See objects 1136 (a large walnut) and 25 (a hooded brass lantern) for examples.

"Orcs"
"@GAverage Statistics for Orcs@n

Height: males about 5'2\" - 6'6\"
        females about 5' - 6'6\"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greatest of manes.  What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Occasional shades of dark brown or
      the infrequent shade of ruddy reddish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises.  The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Affiliation: orcs are a dark race.

Appearance: Orcs frequently have dusky-hued skin tending towards shades
of brown or red.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's more pathetic than smooth, boring skin.

Orcs are not known for their great dental hygiene and often have cracked,
yellowed and missing teeth.  Fortunately for them they often grow back
missing teeth once lost.  Enlarged tusk-like canines often protrude from
the lower jaw noticeably.  Their noses are typically upturned, giving them
a pig-like or boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of the
so-called good races.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing an Orc@n

Orcs are typically slow and a bit dumb, never the less they know how to
be tough, wily and strong foes worthy of respect.  Orcs primarily dwell
underground and, though they can tolerate sunlight, prefer not to and
will assuredly whine at being made to spend time in the light.  Their
long years of growing as a society in the cramped tunnels and caves left
to them as the hand-me-downs of larger, brutish dark races or the more
cunning vyans has produced some pretty strong traits.  Most orcs are not
shy or withdrawn and prefer to take what they can get.  This makes for a
very combative society and one that has learned to take its own abuse. 
Their favorite hobby would have to be tormenting the goblins that somehow
always manage to be present wherever there are orcs.  Its considered
great sport, after all, they just keep taking the abuse and there are
always more.

After years of living this way, orcs finally came into contact with
humans.  Though brutal at first, some orcs did see the advantage to
living above ground in artificial caves (houses), particularly if you
build them without windows, thus keeping sunlight out.  When this faction
left, leaving more space in the caves, the remaining orcs rejoiced
greatly and proceeded to fight over the extra free space.  The split, over
many years, has caused orcs to evolve into two main groups.  An eastern
orc, seen most commonly around Voaleth, who tend to be more tribal,
chaotic and senselessly brutal.  And a western orc, seen most commonly
around Brithbarad, known to be somewhat larger and more cunning in their
brutal plots.

Orcs subsist on a meat-only diet; they are not able to digest vegetables.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Orcs are known to to be none to fond of elves, finding their best value
to be the way they bleed so easily when cut, pounded or smashed.
Elves are also a good supply of elven teeth, which make fine keepsakes of
memorable raids on the unwary elf hunting party.

Despite their close resemblance to elves, orcs grudgingly respect vyans. 
After all, how bad can a people who slaughter elves even more than you do
be?

Dwarves and gnomes only have value as slaves, food or both in orcish eyes.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres, seeing them as little
more than really large orcs.

Goblins, having turned out to be poor slaves who were too weak and lazy
as workers and too inconsistent in work quality, and about as hard to get
rid of as roaches turned out to be almost adequate allies.  They make for
great fodder in a fight and are a nearly endless source of mirth as the
butt of jokes and target of cruelty.  They just keep taking it and there
are always more.  When you break one, there always seems to be two more
ready to take its place.

Orcs and trolls do not tend to get along well at all, always managing to
find something to fight over (usually involving possessions or food),
except when hunting elves.

Humans are an odd lot and are alternately tolerated and hated by orcs
depending on whatever the current leaders' whims seem to be.  Where some
humans serve the dark forces they tend to make good allies, while humans
that serve the light are bothersome nuisances and frequently go the way
of elves.  Which is to say they end up a smear on some orc's war club.

Lizardfolk remain a nearly complete enigma.  They lived in the swamps
and, as everyone knows, there aren't caves under a swamp, just more swamp. 
Worse than that, there are only two ways to get there.  Through human
lands, and the humans keep stopping orcs to fight or talk, either one is
better than walking all day.  Or through the Vaasa, and there are just so
many elves to kill there's never a good enough reason to get to the other
side of the Vaasa.  Why go through when you can stop half way and just
keep killing elves until you're ready to go home?

"Osse"
"Osse, Rainlord and Master of Water, is god of Water, spring, and the oceans of
the realm.  Legend tells of him appearing as a large figure of water striding
on land, without losing form or cohesion.  More often, he offers signs of his
presence as an unexpected, localized rainfall.  Also, plants, particularly
flowering ones, that spring forth from barren ground are said to be a sign of
Osse, in his aspect of Spring.

As all the elemental deities, Osse remains neutral in the strife between
gods.  He does not seem to care much for any affairs of mortals, save for
those who dwell within or near the water.  Fishermen are said to be under his
protection, save they honor the sea and do not overharvest.  His rather
taciturn nature is given over to a more joyous one, though still somewhat
somber, in the season of spring.  The Master of Water wakes the earth and
again stirs life up from its dormant winter sleep.  The many rains during
spring are said to be Osse's sign of affection for this time of year.

The Rainlord's symbol is a stylized drop of water, point up.  Alternatively,
those Ossean followers who follow the ocean aspect honor the symbol of a
stylized cresting wave.

Osse accepts worshippers of any alignment, provided they understand the
importance of Water.

Allowed worshipper alignments: any

"Paladin"
"@IIn the beginning, temples were easy targets, so they hired warriors and
fighters to protect them.  Over time, these temple protectors not only came to
practice their arts of war, but also became devout to the temple's god.  In
this way, they became the strong arm of the church, where their unique
combination of skills were needed.  Hence, the Paladin was born.
@IBecause of their devotion to a god, paladins gain a wide assortment of
simple spells.  Useful spells such as create light, food, water and other
curative spells are complimented by the more powerful spells of @Eremove
curse@n, and @Esanctify@n.  However, gaining these benefits cost these
paladins to lose some of their formidable warrior skills.  They cannot hit
quite as often as true warriors, but they learn the powerful skills of @Eturn
undead@n and @Elay hands@n.  This mixture of spells and skills make Paladins a
very powerful class, one that relies less on others for survival in a harsh
world.

"pet_rules"
"Pets can be a lot of fun and good helpers in the realm.  However, they
can also be horribly abused.  Pets are any mob following you that you
have control over that is not you.  Familiars, mounts, animals/living
things bought at pet stores, and animals/living things tamed by ranger
pet spells, and created/owned undead are all considered pets. 
Unfortunately there's also room for abuse where pets are concerned, so
here's a little lit of what not to do 
(some of these things can get you banned).

@C
You are not allowed to aquire pets with the intent to release them later
to kill them.
  @C-This means no wounding pets, making them sleep, releasing them, killing them.
  @C-This mean no taming a pet to remove it from the safety of its guardians.
    @C(ie taming sheep to remove them from Pennan to kill them elsewhere)
 @C-This also means no taming the white timber wolf to remove her from her mate
   with intent to release/kill her so you can tame her mate.
   @C(a hint, there IS a legal way to achieve taming the male)

You are not allowed to send them into battles you are not a part of.
  @C-In particular this means no sending hords of pets in to kill shop keepers
   while you stand idly by and watch them get killed by the keeper and guards.
   Honestly, what keeper/guard wouldn't notice you give the orders and attack
   you?  The code just can't handle that yet, so its not allowed.
@n

The imms can see when you aquired pets, when they are released and when they die.
It looks awfully suspicious to check your player log and find you die
once to every 20 pet deaths.  It looks equally suspicious to see you
tamed a dozen animals and released them shortly thereafter.  In fact,
that looks more like you're moving them elsewhere to be killed or killing
them yourselves.
Granted, pets will die, but there's a difference between reasonable
chance of death and abusing the options given you.  In particular this
occurs with rangers.  A ranger's communion with nature allows them to
tame the pets.  I would hate to see tame end up like familiars, only one
tame per level, because rangers are abusing it.  -Talis

"Phule's Laws"
"TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to The Forest's Edge
get their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you
start your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!
@I
@I Law 1: Self-Preservation.  Set your @bwimpy@n.  What \"wimpy\" does is engage a
sense of self-preservation in your character.  Typing \"wimpy flee 20\" will get
your character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of course) is
beaten down to 20 percent of their hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't simply
rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  @bFlee@ning (typing \"flee\") will
also get you to protect your tender hide.
@I
@I Law 2: Con before kill, look before you leap.  Before you even *think*
about attacking a mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To
do this type \"con monster_name\" -- perhaps \"con goat\" -- and hit enter. 
This will make your character \"consider\" his/her chance of success
against that monster in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you
come accross, type \"kill monster_name.\" Also, before you wander into
unknown territory, type \"scan.\" This will get your character to look
around the general area and see if there are any monsters lurking about. 
If scan shows that there is an evil newbie-eater to the east, don't go
east.
@I
@I Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were
feeling hungry or thirsty.  Here at TFE you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers
and brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food
can be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type \"eat bread\" or \"drink fountain\" to eat and drink.
@I
@I Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type \"skin corpse\"
after the fight has ended.
@I
@I Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
at TFE, you need to @bpractice@n and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you
much good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters)
have been around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type \"prac\" in
a room where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught
there, a list of skills will appear.  Type \"prac skill_name\" to train
inthat skill.  Type \"abil\" to see a list of your abilites which can be
learned.
@I
@I
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Remember, if all else fails and you find yourself killed until dead,
Death might give you a second chance to gain revenge on the
slavering-fanged monster which sent you packing to the netherworld. 
Chances are your corpse will sill be laying around with your equipment in
it.  Happy MUDding!!

"Phule's Standards for Objects"
"phule's standards for objects:

non magical objects should all be level 1.

if an object deviates strongly from the standard, it is probably magical
(magically-thin or very lightweight plate armor with better AC than
heavy, thick, iron plate, for instance).

so this help file tries to lay out the 'level 1' standards for objects,
as well as how objects deviate from level 1 as they deviate from the
standard non-magical base.

see: Phule's Standards for Weapons

"Phule's Standards for Weapons"
"phule's standards for weapons.

as phule's standards for objects starts to lay out, this is in the series
of defining the level 1 baselines for weapons.

the baseline for weapons has 5 factors: type, damage weight, material,
and durability.  damage is a factor of weight, so this reduces to 4
factors.  durability is a factor of material, so we have only 3 factors:
type, material, and weight.  weight can be contradicted by two handed
weapons, and weapon type also offsets weight (4 pound staff much easier
to swing than a 4 pound sword).  also, material and weight should be able
to roughly determine the size of the object - think about density of the
metal you are working with.

For instance, the same sword made of iron and steel, the steel sword
weighs less.  so, a steel sword the same size as an iron sword, the iron
sword does more damage because it weighs more.  However the steel sword
can be swung faster, and as history will tell you, the weight of the
sword wasn't everything, after a handful of pounds, all that matters is
that it was even close to sharp and was moving fast.

Thus what we should find is that an iron sword and a steel sword should
do the SAME damage, but the steel sword will be lighter and more durable.

types:
unarmed, dagger, sword, club, staff, polearm, mace, whip, axe, bow, spear.

material:
bronze, iron, steel, mithril, adamantine.

so what we really need is a big, strange, colorful, 5-dimensional graph
plotting weapon type and material vs.  damage and weight.

what you get is...

TYPE    | WEIGHT  | DAMAGE
---------------------------------
unarmed | 0.0     | 1d4
dagger  | 1.0     | 1d8
sword   | 3.0     | 1d12

staff   | 3.0     | 2d4
polearm | 5.0     | 2d8

"Pkill"
"The official TFE policy enforced both by code and by the immortals is a game
free of direct player killing.  To satisfy the obvious conflict that exists
between races, clans and religions two major forms of pkill exist on the mud.

@RZone@n
Three zones in TFE are currently open to player killing; these are the Elven
Village.  the Ice Troll Town and the Gnomish Picnic.  In addition, the Arena
Zone allows player combat without loss of equipment or experience points at
death.  Anytime in which you are in a Pkill capable room, a capital letter
'@RP@n' appears at the head of your prompt.

All three of these zones are not easily discoverable for the new player, so
you should not worry.  Nonetheless, caution should be taken when following a
leader who you do not know.

@RImportant note:@n some of these zones have restrictions on summoning and recall
spells to prevent abuse.  Be careful to test out these spells when exploring
these zones for the first time so you are aware that recall, summon, and other
transfer spells may or may not work reliably in these zones.

@BClan@n
The other form of Pkill exists when two clans declare and agree to a war
against each other.  During this time members of both clans are open to Pkill
from opposing clan members (as well as their own clan members for such cases
as a double-cross).

Any additional questions concerning Pkill can be addressed to either an Avatar
or Immortal.  Remember if you think something *MAY* be illegal ask an immortal
first *BEFORE* taking action.

"player-run shops"
"@e (This is a preliminary version of the restrictions and costing of player-run
shops and is still subject to change.) @n

In addition to clan strongholds, which are only available to clans, players
can open their own shops.  This helpfile describes both the restrictions
around placement and operation of these shops as well as cost information.

@eRestrictions@n
@C*@n Shops must be placed within the walls of or near an existing town.  To
facilitate trade, central locations are preferred; a request to place a shop
in an obscure location (i.e.  crabman village) will probably be refused unless
you can justify a good RP reason.

@C*@n You must have a positive, or at worst, neutral reputation with the nation of
the town you plan to operate in or near.  If your reputation with the nation
becomes negative, it will be closed and your funds will not be returned.

@C*@n You must be willing to keep your shop open for at least 8 hours a week.  You
don't have to run the shop yourself, but you or another player need to be
present for at least that amount of time.  Player-run shops may not use NPC
shopkeepers of any kind.

@eCosts@n
@C*@n The cost of opening a shop is 1000 platinum.  If you can't afford this and
still want to open a shop, send me a mail and I'll see what we can work out.
This includes only 1 room, which may not be a storeroom, a locking mechanism
of the buyer's choice, and up to 30 items that function as keys in whatever
manner the player desires.  Additional rooms for other merchandise use the
same costs outlined in help strongholds, with the exceptions of banks or
arenas, which are not allowed in shops.  Opening in a more exotic location
(hidden shop, or in a cabin several rooms away from a town) will cost an
additional 500pp.

@C*@n Costs for furniture, tables, cases to display merchandise, etc.  are the
same as for strongholds.  See help strongholds for more information on these
costs.

@C*@n In addition to the opening and construction costs, you will also be subject
to paying taxes to the city in which you choose to operate.  These taxes vary
by town to town; expect to pay more where there are fewer guards to ensure the
'safety' of your establishment.  You are responsible for reporting and paying
your own taxes on a monthly basis (request an immortal to do this) based on
the tax rate that we quote you when you open your shop.  You can try to fudge
or not pay these fees if you like, but your shop may be subject to audit or
your possessions to confiscation if you decide to go this route.  You should
expect this tax rate to be anywhere from 10 to 50% of the profit generated by
your shop.

- Pit similar level mobs against your new mobs.
- Create dummy players for playtesting (Player1, Player2, etc)
- Use real players

When using real players, it is important to use people who will both try
to break the area and can be trusted.

General rules for playtesting with real players:
- All eq and gold received is to be junked.
- Deaths which are not from bugs will not be reimbursed
- Keep the XP which you get (see above for opposite)

"Policies"
"@WPlayer Names@n - Players should choose a name that fits their character
and the medieval time period.  Immortals are encouraged to be lenient in
enforcing this, but characters with blatantly unacceptable names will be
asked to change them.  Examples of unacceptable names are Television,
GoBlue and IamGreat.

@WImmortal Help@n - minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed unless in cases of bugs. 
Both players and immortals will be disciplined for this.

@WAbusing Bugs@n - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bugs can
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for
such abuse.  If it is too good to be true, it probably is, and you'd
better report it.

@WReimbs@n - Reimbursements may be given in some cases for losses due to
major bugs.  The normal reimbursement is the equipment you had as of the
last backup of the player files.  This may not be all that you lost but
eliminates the problem of lying so no other equipment reimbursement will
be given.  Deaths or losses due to lag are not eligible for
reimbursements.  Items lost in a crash are not eligible for reimbursement
unless they were lost on a corpse.

@WMulti Playing@n - Multi Playing is not allowed.  It gives too much of
an advantage over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes solo'ing and
works against the social structure of the mud.  Similarly, players should
not trade equipment between their own characters, or assist others in
doing so.  Each account may have only one character on at a time, and
playing multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted. 
Multiplayers may reasonably expect themselves to be purged.

@W5-Minute Rule@n - A corollary to the rule against multiplaying.  This
rule applies to those players with more than one character.  To switch
playing one character for another, you must wait AT LEAST five minutes
before connecting as the new or 'second' character.

@WDeath Traps@n - Death traps ruin the fun of exploring and make life
frustrating.  Areas will not contain 'automatic death' traps.

@WLanguage@n - We ask that players not curse or use offensive language. 
While it is impossible for Immortals to monitor all channels all the
time, we ask that you police yourselves and that you please be sensitive
to your company, both those in the room with you, in the area, and on the
mud as a whole.  Players have complained about this in the past, and
minors do log on here.  Please be considerate to others during your stay
at The Forest's Edge.

@W\"Bots\"@n - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension. 
Bots, or automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the
human element from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive
series of scripted actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we
seek to foster at The Forest's Edge.  As a result, players are not
permitted to run or use bots.

@WTriggers@n - Limited use of triggers is permitted.  Use of triggers to run your
character while you are not attending the session is botting and is not
allowed.  Use of triggers to permit another player to run your character
remotely is not permitted.  Each player is responsible for their own character.

@WItem/Mob Stats@n -TFE has had a long-standing policy asking that players do not
give out stats for items, mobs, quests, etc over public channels.  In a group
or between friends such information is often shared but please refrain from
discussing the details on public channels.  Public channels would be chat,
gossip, atalk, newbie or any similar channel.

@W\"Area stealing\"@n -We ask the players who encounter other players or groups who
are also adventuring in the same area as you or your group to work things out
peacefully on your own without involving the immortals.  It is strongly
encouraged that players learn how to share or work out other arrangements when
involved in such a situation.  However, harassment and intentional abuse of
other players will not be tolerated.

players SHOULD NOT have modified stats or be aided by the immortal in anyway.

Death Traps - Death traps ruin the fun of exploring and make life very
frustrating.  There should be no death traps in any area.

\"Bots\" - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension.  Bots, or
automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the human element
from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive series of scripted
actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we seek to foster at The
Forest's Edge.  As a result, players are not permitted to run or use bots.

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Practice is the command used to pay a trainer to improve you in a skill. 
Practicing costs gold and practice points.  In most towns there are
trainers who can teach you the basic skills, but it may not be obvious
who they are.  An example is Prenslie in Chiiron can train some spells. 
Skills and spells above level 15 generally must be sought after outside
of towns.

"Practice Points"
"Practice points may be gained according to the following criteria:

@Ias \"bonus\" practices, gained while leveling (below level 12);
@Ior when a skill is used successfully;
@Ithey are not determined by XP gain;
@Ievery so often, one has a chance to gain a prac if he or she uses a
@I   skill successfully;
@Ione's chance to gain practice points is modified by INT and WIS.

INT and WIS also affect the maximum number of pracs which your character
may possess at any one time.  (\"The Grey Matter Quotient\", also affected
by level.) 

@bFor example@n:
Bob \"Genghis\" Khan goes about fighting critters, in his battles he uses
skills he already knows.  Bob \"Genghis\" Khan then gains a practice point
because he is using his skills and has a high wis and intelligence.  Then
after a while again he gets another, becuase his situation met the above
criteria.  Bob \"Genghis\" Khan can then use those practices once he has
found a teacher and practice any skill which is available.

If you are in dire need you can try praying for assistance.  The gods of the
game might intervene on your behalf if you have been leading a pious lifestyle
and have not been calling on them too often.  This command does not contact
player gods but instead the god of your religion.  Some sample needs are
light, food, water, and hit points which the gods may give you in response to
your prayers.  The command takes no argument and your god determines what kind
of aid you receive.

@CIf you need an immortal@n, ask on gossip first.  If they do not respond it
is because they are busy or not available.  Request an immortal using the
request command (see help request) and an immortal will get to you once one
has a chance.
 
@CIf you need approval of your appearance, keywords, and description@n, use
the request command.  The Avatars (noted by the AV next to their name on the
who list) handle that.
  
@CHow Immortals deal with people@n:
- For the first offense, you will probably get a warning, but you may recieve
a minor punishment.
- If you are caught breaking the rules after being warned, you may be jailed,
banned, or frozen.  Depending on the severity of the offense, you may be
banned for several days, a week, or permanently.
  
@CIf you ask an imm something and they say no@n, do not bother going from imm
to imm until one says yes.  If you honestly feel the imm is wrong, contact a
higher power by mailing them an explaination of the problem (see help rank for
the current immortals.) Otherwise, you are only setting yourself up for
failure.  Each player has a player file on which the imms put little notes
(player was caught stealing, name was changed, etc) If we catch you playing,
\"If mommy says no, I'll go ask daddy and maybe he'll say yes\", then it gets
noted on your player file as well, and any arguments on your point will
probably be viewed as somewhat surreptitious by imms from that point on.
    
@CIf you need help doing something@n:
  -If it is in-game, ask another player through say, gossip or chat.
   In-game includes things like:
      I am hungry, where can I get food?
      How can I earn money?
      What are the best things to kill for experience?
      How do I get more practice points?
   
  -If it is out-of-game and game related, ask on ooc or gossip.
   Out-of-game includes things like:
      What temperature do I cook pizza at? (on ooc)
      How about that local sports team? (on ooc)
      What exactly does our Dexterity do for our characters? (ooc)

"Protect life"
"This spell attempts to transfer the subject out of danger the instant before
they die.  It takes a large toll on the caster in mana and regeneration, but
is very useful when entering unknown areas.  Due to its nature and the
uncertainty of death this spell is difficult to get right and is often known
to fail, especially when cast at lower levels.  In contrast objects with the

"quest_standards"
"@bQUEST STANDARDS@n

After spending a great deal of time looking over the existing quests it was apparent there was no real order to the manner in which they were made.
This is intended to be a means by which quests can be more uniformly made.

@bQuest Points@n
Quest points should reflect the difficulty of the quest.

If a quest has no real level of challenge (perhaps just run from point A to
point B and fetch an unguarded item) it should only have 1 quest point.  There
should still be some effort involved.  Perhaps the item is in another city or
something or doesn't have a 100% respawn rate in one place.

Just because a quest is higher level doesn't mean it has to have a bigger
quest point value.  A quest that requires a player be level 50 but is only
fetch an item from Medienne and hand it to someone in Chiiron is still only
worth 1 quest point unless its dangerous to get the item.
Most often, however, higher level quests involve larger guardians and are
tougher to accomplish in which case they should be worth more points.  Look at
existing quests to determine how many points a quest should be worth.

If a quest has a tangible reward at the end it should be worth slightly less
than it normally might.  Perhaps one or two points depending on how nice the
item/reward is.  That doesn't mean a reward should mean no quest points, they
have done the work and deserve the points as well just perhaps not as many.

@g- - - - -@n
@YHumans@n

The basic race type, we should all be familiar with this one.

Height: Male about 5 feet 2 inches - 6 feet tall on average
        Female about 5 feet- 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@g- - - - -@n
@YVyan@n

Height: male about 4'8\"-5'8\"     (' means feet)
        female about 4'6\"-5'6\"   (\" means inches)

Hair: typically stright. Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      brown or blond (extremely rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Though other colors such as brilliant blues
      or grays to black are not uncommon.

Note: Skin tones range primarily from midnight black to pale, wan colors. 
The vyan with the healthy glow of sun burnished skin is almost completely
unheard of.

Note: Vyans age very slowly.  You probaby won't see wrinkles before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOrcs@n

Height: males about 5'2\" - 6'6\"
        females about 5' - 6'6\"

Hair: Orcs typically don't have the greates of manes. What hair does grow
      tends to be black and coarse.  Ocassional shade of dark brown
      or the infrequent shade of ruddy redish-brown do occur.

Eyes: Typically dark shades of brown or black irises. The area around the
      iris is a sallow yellowish or grey-white at best.

Note: Orcs frequently have dusky-hues skin tending towards shades of
browns and reds.  Warts are commonplace and, in some tribes, considered
marks of great beauty.  Nothing's worse than plain smooth, boring skin.

Note: Orcs have poor dental hiegene but also have hearty teeth that often
grow in once lost.  Enlarged, tusk-like canines often protrude from the
lower jaw noticably.  Noses are often upturned, giving them a pig-like or
boarish appearance according to the nastier comments of so-called good
races.

@g- - - - -@n
@YOgres@n

Height: males about 6'6\" - 7'6\"
        females about 6'4\" - 7'2\"

Hair: Ogres have hair most frequently in browns, blacks, and reds
      and rarely gray.  It is usually coarse, bristly or patchy.
      Facial hair is extremely rare, almost unheard of, though
      ear and nose hair as well as shoulder and back hair are common.

Eyes: Ogres tend to have dull, beady eyes ranging in colors of mainly
      greys.  Sometimes hints of red or black have appeared though rarely.
      Irises are large leaving only a little of the sallow to gray
      surrounding the eyes visible.

Note: Ogres are often muscular, but odd protuberances as well as frequent
patches of hair-covered warts can confuse the bulky shape.  Most ogres
have poor posture.  Ogre skin is usually a dusky shade of grey-brown,
sandy brown, or ruddy red-brown and is always somewhat rubbery.

@g- - - - -@n
@YTrolls@n

Height: males about 6'4\" - 7'4\"
        females about 6'6\" - 7' 6\"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to black hair, not always on their
      head.  Where hair grows it is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls tend to have white hair, with at least
      some on their head more so than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.

Note: Trolls have green skin in varying hues (though none are what would
be termed bright, neon, or electric green), They are often warty or have
cancerous appearing growths though these do not seem to affect their
health negatively in any way, rather it appears to be an excess of their
ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost never have scars, as they heal so
incredibly well.  For a race that is typically foul, corupt and evil they
have the incongruous gift of incredible regeneration at the cost of a
never-ending hunger.

@g- - - - -@n
@YGoblins@n

Height: males and females about 3'6\" - 4'4\"

Hair: Not all goblins have hair, in fact, many have none at all.
      What hair they do grow is usually black or brown and often
      caked in muck and fiflth.  Goblins have no facial hair.

Eyes: Like most of the dark races, goblins have eyes that are primarily
      black and beady, though some have turned up with shades of
      dark brown or reddish-brown.  The iris extends to the edge
      of the eye with only a pupil which dilates between a pinprick
      in size to a large circle as lighting permits.

Note: Goblins have craggy skin in colors of earthy greens and browns or
patchy/mottled earthtone mixes.  Though they have warts and protuberances
less frequently than orcs, ogres, and trolls they are not completely
infrequent in some clans.  Goblins tend to have sharp teeth, though they
are small and wouldn't ordinarily be called fangs.

@g- - - - -@n
@YLizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6\" - 6'2\"

Eyes: Reptillian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Notes: Lizardfolk, lacking hair for descriptions, often employ the
descriptions of the various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the way a
snake's scales form interesting patterns, the lizardfolk develop patterns in
many tones.  Included are clans with anywhere from subdued, earthy tones to
ones with vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow.  Lizardfolk skin is
typically soft and smooth like a snakes, though wet, fish-like skin and raspy
crocodile-like skin has been noted before as well.

        Female about 5 feet - 5 feet 10 inches on average

Hair: Ranging in colors primarily of blond, brown, black, red
      (rarely white or gray unless advanced years)

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green or Gray (rare) iris
      White around the iris unless very sick.

@YElves@n

Height: male about 4'8\"-5'8\"    (' means feet)
       female about 4'6\"-5'6\"   (\" means inches)

Hair: typically straight.  Light colors (white / blond ) to darkish brown.
      black (very rare).  NO FACIAL HAIR.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      brown or blue.  Though other colors such as amber
      lavender, or other light colors are not uncommon.

Note: Elves have skin tones that range in most human ranges but almost
always touched with a healthy glow from sunlight.  Elves almost never
have pale or sickly looking skin.

Note:Elves age very slowly.  You probably wont see wrinkles Before they
reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it would be very
faint and hard to notice them for another few hundred years.

      (they 'could' be shaved odd daily, but such dwarves
       should be ostracized by imms/players at every given
       chance.  freaks. :P )

      White around iris, though iris is large.

Note: All dwarves grow facial hair.

@YEnts@n

Height: males about 6'6\" - 7'6\"

Hair: Bristly or \"twiggy\" in earth tones.
      Dark-light browns, grays, blacks, ruddy reds,
      sandy-blonds.  Most ents also have \"twiggy\" beards.

Eyes: also earthy colors. blacks, grays, browns and green
      predominate though silver and green are not unheard
      of.  Iris extends to edge of eye, no whites.

notes: ENTS ARE NOT TREES.  Imagine a troll with brownish, craggy skin
though not slimy or warty.  That's an ent.  They don't have leaves, they
don't bleed sap.  Ents have 7 toes on each foot, though this need not be
put in description.  Most ents have beards.  Ents have big heads.

@YGnomes@n

Height: male about 3'6\" - 4'6\"

Hair: most commonly darker shades of black or brown though
      shades of blonde and grey are not unheard of.
      A dusky red is, at best, quite rare.

Eyes: Brown, Blue, Green, Grey (usually dark) and black
      large irises surrounded by white.  As the irises are
      large, so are the pupils from years of time underground.

Note: Skin tones run through all normal human ranges, though tend more
ferquently to duskier hues.

@YHalflings@n

Height: males about 3'2\" - 4'
        females about 3'2\" - 3'10\"

Hair: Mostly shades of brown, some blonde or reds.  Black (rare)
      Facial hair is rare at best.

Eyes: Tending towards all natural human shades.

Note: Halflings appear much like human children though they do develop
wrinkles, graying hair and other adult attributes.  Halflings often
develop a stout build, some say due to the 5 regulated meals a day they
tend to enjoy as opposed to the 3 a day most other races attend. 
Halflings are not hobbits.  We aren't going to ban you for having hairy
feet, but realize, it is not the norm.

@g- - - - -@n
@YLizardfolk@n

Height: male and female 5'6\" - 6'2\"

Hair: (you're kidding, right?)  They don't grow hair.

Eyes: Reptillian eyes, vertically slit pupils surrounded by an
      all-enveloping iris in shades from red to amber to yellow.

Notes: Lizardfolk, lacking hair for descriptions, often employ the
descriptions of the various colors depicted by their scales.  Much the
way a snake's scales form interesting patterns, the lizardfolk develop
patterns in many tones.  Included are clans with anywhere from subdued,
earthy tones to ones with vibrant hues of red, orange and yellow. 
Lizardfolk skin is typically soft and smooth like a snakes, though wet,
fish-like skin and raspy crocodile-like skin has been noted before as
well.

"Rdesc_Standards"
"Room descriptions are just that: @bdescription@n.  They are not
narration, they do not tell stories, give players history, gossip, or any
information which they could not obtain from standing in a spot and
examining their surroundings.  It is the players' job to make inferences,
even the most basic, and put together the raw data.  Rdescs assume
nothing.

Rdescs define rooms; they are the firmament of The Forest's Edge, and
should only include the @bpermanent@n traits of the room.  Referring to
an ogre's breath in the next room is not appropriate in an rdesc; if the
ogre is killed or out at the local sports bar, this descriptive detail
would not make sense.  [This example would be more appropriately handled
as an action which used the mob_in_room function to check if the ogre was
present in his lair.] Similarly, things like weather conditions, time of
day, etc. are equally inappropriate.

Rextras should be provided for prominent items in the rdesc.

Room descriptions should not have players @bdo@n anything.  This rule can
be violated in extreme cases (perhaps sensing some trepidation entering a
cavern full of bones) but generally you should never write \"You feel
happy as you walk through the beautiful woos.\" Why?  Have the real
person, in real life, become happy from your prose; show them that their
character should be happy, and they will be, tell them to be happy and
the rdesc rings false and sounds awkward and canned.  Similarly, rdescs
describe - having a player *do* anything in one is no good.  This is
where actions come in; use them.  If you don't know how to code
something, ask for help.

@bCover the basics@n.  Always remember that your first job is to give the
player a handle of his or her situation and his/her immediate
surroundings.  Where is the player?  What does he see?  Where may he go? 
This is the job of the rdesc, first and foremost.

Any questions or suggestions for improvement on this rough, please let me
know.  Thanks.

This is used to create descriptions that players can reference by typing look
<name>.  Name may be a list of words that will work and before each name a
optional number is allowed specifying required number of characters that must
match.  For example if you want look e to reference an extra called east you
would set name to \"1 east\".  Rdesc is the command used to edit the text of the
extra you are currently editting.  When moving a room from one area to
another, all exits and acodes are left untouched.  Calls to find_room( <room
#> ) are NOT updated; you will have to find and fix them manually.  You can
use rfind (see the help file for it) to automatically search the soft code for
references to the room about to be moved.

Typically redit move shouldn't be needed.  This is primarily useful for
breaking up zones that were originally both city zones and hunting/combat
zones.  If you happen to use redit move you must use @brfind -p@n as well to
ensure you don't break existing code refering to that room.  This will create
some lag as the rfind command searches all existing codes for reference to the
room in question.  Use wisely please.

undead; cleric cannot initiate battle against good-aligned creature (but can
assist or fight back if attacked)

Taranth
Taranth's blessing - spell, level 60, healing spell that doesn't require prepping.
Peace (need good name) - spell, works the same way as imm skill peace, would
have to be high level and fail some of the time, or take pray points to
function so it wasn't abused.

Tarafas
Freylia
Harvest's blessing - spell, group-affecting, fills hunger/thirst to full on
whole group.

Slen
Luck of the Lady - spell, leech, targeted; chance that physical attack or

Wind Gate - recall that lets you save a recall point that you can go back to
via this spell until you set a new point.
Dance of the wind - innate (or leech?) - displace-like spell.

Kantos
Steadfastness (need name) - Immunity to traditional bash or trip/sweepkick.
Set_resting would still work.  Innate, cleric-only (or leech?  expensive).

Osse
Permanent water-breathing - effect (caster-only), becomes innate.

@eEvil pantheon@n
Temohpab
Wrath of the Unicorn - innate skill, all attacks do double damage vs.  good,
1/2 (or even 1/3) vs. evil creatures.

Morkith

alternatively to the path of death (doesn't kill caster, only causes death
weakness)
(offensive chaos spell) - randomly does damage to someone, or kills the mob,
or causes them to flee, or causes them to do a random social, or heals them
(small cure).  Should do good damage or would be useless.

"Remort"
"Remorting is available to players who have attained experience level 90. 
Since advancement beyond level 90 is not permitted, most players choose to
\"remort\", meaning re-create their character at level 1 with bonuses.  The
player is allowed to retain his name, race, sex, alignment, and/or class if
desired, or may choose entirely new ones.

All money and equipment (whether worn, held in inventory, or in the bank) will
be retained.  Worn and inventory equipment will be moved to the player's bank
account.  Items you've customed that are size-specific will be re-sized to fit
your new character's body size.

All the player's pets will be removed from the game upon remorting.  Be sure
to retrieve any valuables they are carrying for you before remorting.

Upon remorting, the following data will be cleared: religion, clan, recognize,
reputation, quests.

The current remort bonuses include:

1.  An additional 50 creation points, allowing higher strength, intelligence,
wisdom, dexterity, and constitution.  The racial maximum value of each of
these statistics is increased by one each time you remort.

2. A 5% bonus to all resistances: fire, acid, etc.

3. An additional 250 pounds of space in the bank vault.

Contact an immortal if you have reached level 90 and wish to remort.

See also: request.
"
"@eIMMORTAL NOTES@n

You must have \"players\" permissions to remort a player.
The procedure for remorting a 90th level player is:

1.  Warn them that their existing character will be gone forever, and make
sure they wish to proceed anyway.

2.  \"medit <player>\".

3.  \"mflag remort\" - sets the remort mflag.

4.  Tell the player that, when they quit and log back on, the remort process
will begin.

@eCUSTOM ITEM RESIZING@n

Items customed by the player will be automatically re-sized to the remort's
race.  The code attempts to make sure the character customed them himself, so
that custom-fit items poped from a mob, or customed by another player, If a
player complains that an item hasn't been resized automatically, use \"oiflag
<item>\" to check the size flags as follows:

1.  The custom_fit oiflag should be set.
2.  The race_specific oiflag should be set.
3.  The race oiflag corresponding to the player's old race should have been
set when he customed the item, and reset when the remort happened.
4.  The race oiflag corresponding to the remort's race should have been set by
remort.
5.  All other size oiflags should be clear.

If the size oiflags don't follow these rules, the player probably didn't
custom the item himself.

The abbreviations listed under condition are described below:

wls = worthless
dmg = damaged
vwn = very worn
wrn = worn
vsc = very scratch
scr = scratched
rea = reasonable
goo = good
vgo = very good

To set a repair level on an item use oset repair while to set it on a
shop the command is shedit repair.  You should keep in mind that the

"Request Ally"
"Through the ages, a mage has found his or her familiar to be more than
just a useful companion.  Often a mage's familiar has become an extension
of the mage.  Yet, limited by their small size, most were viewed as
nothing more than trained pets.  Such is no longer the case.  An
archmage, by tapping into planar magics, has been able to come up with a
spell designed to summon powerful allies that are more than just mere
familiars.  In order for this spell to be successful, it must be cast on
an item likely to have some special meaning or semblance to the desired

@eDESCRIPTION@n

The resets have 3 chance fields.  When an area or mob is being reset, 3
dice are thrown.  If the first chance is accepted it checks on the second
and the same for the third.  If a chance is 0% it passes if the previous
roll passed.  A dice is rerolled whenever the reroll flag for that column
is set.  This is indicated by a * in the Rrl column.  The reroll flags
are set using a 1, 2 or 3 for the flag.

( The following is a brief explaination of how resets work.  Every reset
has a mob/object identifier, 3 chances and a set of flags associated with
it.  When an area resets, all rooms without players in it are cleared of
all objects except mob/player corpses.  The mud then runs through the
resets for the room.  Each reset has 3 \"chances\".  These are the numbers
switch for each chance saying whether the roll for this chance should be
rerolled when this reset is hit.
This implies that the first reset should have all 3 reroll stars set.)

Object Flags:
  C)ontainer - Object is flaged as a container
  I)nside - Object goes in last object loaded with C flag set.
  O)verload - object replaces any other object already reset worn in the
    same position and layer.
  H)idden - Object is created with no_show oflag set.

Mob Flags:
  L)eader - Mob is set as a leader
  F)ollower - Mob follows last mob loaded with L flag set.
  M)ount - Mob is a mount for last mob loaded with L flag set.  The leader
  will attempt to mount the mob when it loads.  Note that the leader must
  have the riding mskill to succeed.  The M flag implies the F flag.
  S)entinel - Mob is sentinel, this over-rides the species flag.
  A)ggressive - Mob attacks characters with no provocation.
  P)eaceful - Mob will not attack without first being attacked.
  C)hair - Mob will be resting or sleeping *on* the last object reset with
  object type \"chair\".  The mob's position should be set to \"resting\" or \"sleeping\".

set_rflag and remove_rflag are changed permanently and the room will be saved
with that rflag set.  For example: 'push button' causes remove_rflag( Safe,
room ).  Next repop, the room is not safe, next reboot, the room is not safe. 
There is no way to retrieve the original settings of the rflags, so use
caution in changing rflags and make sure there are ways to change it back.

if you are a rich noble you act like a snobby rich bastard, if you are
one.  RPing makes the game take on a whole new dimension you are no

If the \"Altar\" flag is set, any player can sacrifice.  If, in addition, the
Altar.<align> rflag matching the player's alignment is set, the player will
receive a 50% bonus for sacrificing there.  However, a 33% penalty will be

set.

If the \"Altar\" flag is not set, players trying to sacrifice if the

their item will be taken away and they will be cursed.  Players whose
Altar.<align> flag is set can sacrifice.  In addition, sacrificing corpses of

set_quest( ch, qnum, status )

@W@WPARAMETERS:@n

ch - pointer to character
qnum - pointer to quest involved
status - the status to set the quest to

@eDESCRIPTION@n

Sets the status of a quest on a player.
In most cases the existing quest functions should be used.  assign_quest,
has_quest, update_quest, etc.  This function, in particular, can be far more
powerful in modifying status but it can also lead to some pretty big loops
(ability to infinitely repeat quests for rewards and quest points) so be
careful with it.  This isn't a flaw, its a useful benefit if used correctly.

@W@WVALUES@n for status

-2 - Quest has been failed - use fail_quest( ch, qnum ) instead
-1 - Quest is completed - use update_quest( ch, qnum ) instead
 0 - Quest is not assigned (resets quest, can be done again)
 1 - Assigns the quest to the player - use assign_quest( ch, qnum ) instead
2+ - Useful instead of using c-flags
     These can be used to check the various steps of a quest.
     Then use get_quest( ch, # ) to see test the current quest status.

Do not use set_quest to set a value of 1, -1, or -2 unless you are absolutely
sure of what you are doing.  This function simply sets the status...  the
player receives no messages or quest points.

Note that all integer arithmetic on TFE uses 2's-complement binary with 32
bits.  So, -1 is the same as 0xffffffff, and -2 is the same as 0xfffffffe.  If
you are not careful setting specific bits in the quest value, you could end up
with a reserved value by mistake.  If in doubt, simply don't use bits 0 or 31.

**Whenever using set_quest for values other than -2, -1, 0, or 1 BE SURE TO
USE @Wqbug@n or you'll drive someone else nuts trying to figure out how the quest
works.  **

@WEXAMPLES@n

if( get_quest( ch, 100 ) == 10 ) { // player has completed stage 10 of quest #100
  set_quest( ch, 100, 11 );        // update quest to stage 11

Change position of ch to resting without showing the message '$n sits down.'

resting.  For example, if the player is meditating, mounted, swimming, or
flying, it won't work.  You may wish to follow the call to set_resting( ch )

set_resting( ch, obj );

Or even better:

if( !set_resting( ch ) ) {
  ...failed
}

obj = obj_in_room( 208, room );
if( !set_resting( ch, obj ) ) {
  ...failed

@CDESCRIPTION@n
    
This is used to set up a mob as a shop and set the types of things that
the mob will buy.  To 'build' a shop follow these steps.  
  
1.  mload the mob you want to be the shopkeeper.  A mob doesn't have to
    be a completely new type of mob - it can be one already used as a 
    shop-keeper.
2. reset mob  - to make it keep comming back 
2a. Purge the shopkeeper and reset the room.
3. shed new   - creates the shop
4. shed keep <mob>    - sets the shop keeper to the mob
5.  set the types of items for the shopkeeper to sell/buy: shed <flag>
    for each item type.
7. reset the items in the room: reset <item>
   Make sure you use @breset@n and not @bmreset@n.
And make sure you set the item's position to inventory 'reset # posi inv'.
8.  if you want the shopkeeper to be able to repair items: shed repair
<level> - where <level> is a number 1 to 10(10 being the most skill) 
  
Mobs gain and lose items as follows. Each reset every item that the mob
curently holds has a 10% chance of being removed.  So if a mob has 10
bells and 10 whistles chances are it will lose two items though it
doesn't have to, and they don't have to be one bell and one whistle. 
Every reset the mob will go through its mreset list and add an item if
the right 'roll' comes up.  So on average if you give a mob a 800 (mill)
chance of gaining an item it will roughly have 7 to 9 items at any one
time.  Note you can make a mob hold more than 10 (roughly) items by
giving it more than one 1000 (mill) reset.  

Make sure your shop room has rflag \"safe\" set, so players can't sell an item
then kill the shopkeeper to get it back.  Also, shopkeeper mobs should not
have the \"summonable\" mflag set, to prevent them from leaving their shop to
assist in a fight.

9.  Pet shops: Set rflag Pet.Shop.  Add shopkeeper as normal.  Reset pets to
be sold (must have a price AND must be tameable) in the room that is ONE
higher up from the shop keeper.  (Meaning that if your shop keeper is in room
386, a \"pen\" or holding area for pet resets must be in room 387.  ) Make sure
that the holding room for the pets is rflagged as Lit, so that players will be
able to see them on list in the pet shop owner's room.

"shuvanaguard"
"The Shuvanaguard is an ancient protective order that dwells primarily in the
Vaasa among the llewyrr (the elves).  There are actually non-player characters
(aka mobs) in the game that contain more information about the Shuvanaguard
and you should ask them about the Shuvanaguard if you wish to know more
information.  Alternately, there are players who have joined the Shuvanaguard
that may be willing to explain it to you to some extent as well.  Suffice it
to say, for now, that it is not a clan or a guild or anything of the sort
often seen on muds.  For all intents and purposes it is primarily a role
playing aspect of the game and nothing more.

@G- - - - -@n
Some out of game additions from the creator of the Shuvanaguard...

A lot of people have their own preconceptions what the Shuvanagurd is.
In answer to the questions, I wanted to offer up the original intent.

From an out of game standpoint, there had been a point where becoming a Knight
might be a possibility.  Knighthood seems such a human concept to me but the
concept of a group dedicated to the safety of the people or its land and one
that maintains a code of honor seemed, to me at least, a very elven concept
still.  In short, the Shuvanaguard is basically the elven equivalent of a
Knightly Order.

Bearing that in mind there were a lot of things to consider when designing
it.  Should non-elves be allowed?  Since its symbol is the elven longsword
should it be limited to only sword-wielding classes?  Questions like these.

To answer these, you have to look at some of the realm history from the time
the Shuvanaguard was created.  Back then, elves were just starting to overcome
their xenophobic standpoint.  Prior to that, the elves and humans had been in
a war largely based on misunderstandings of culture and, while time had passed
for the humans the long lifespan and long memory of the elves kept the threat
of war fresh in their mind.  They had spent quite some time secluded in the
Vaasa keeping everyone else.  Keeping in mind that the move of gameplay was
headed towards giving players reasons to play together where reasons could be
found, the idea was to move away from elven xenophobia and towards more
integration.  I can't see the elves actually just forgetting everything but
why not an order dedicated to good and protecting the land that opens its
proverbial doors to others of like-minded good intent.

So the Shuvanaguard was made open to anyone of like-minded beliefs. 
Basically, those who don't directly oppose the elves.  Yes, dwarves and humans
and the like can and should be able to join the Shuvanaguard.  This meshes
well with the fact that the original elven longsword that existed prior to the
Shuvanagaurd version was available to more than just elves.  The original
elven longsword was removed as \"too powerful\" for its level.  The quest to
obtain one limited the number in use as well as making them harder to
acquire.  Thus the benefits of the swords' value was balanced by the
limitations placed on acquiring one and, given that more than elves could get
them, kept it open to those who could have one before it was initially removed.

So why should mages and the like be able to get one if they can't even use the
sword?  The sword, while certainly useful, is also the status symbol marking
its wielder as a member of the Shuvanaguard.  So a mage, who can't physically
wield the sword, should be able to complete the quest and attain the badge of
the order.  Granted, I could have made several items marking people as members
of the Shuvanaguard but the role playing idea is based on the concept and the
sword is a part of that concept.  I've seen more than a few mages who proudly
carry their elven longsword with them after completing the Shuvaguard quest
that I don't think my idea is far off from where it was originally intended. 
They bear their sword with honor and pride regardless of whether they can use
it or not.

I've considered offering a chance for mages, clerics, rogues, what have you
the opportunity to trade in the sword for something more usable but would
generally prefer to leave the longsword in tact.  Granted, that doesn't help
non-sword wielders any but never fear.  Since shortly after finishing the
joining quest, I've wanted to make a second quest that continues after the
first.  In fact, the quest is largely in place and I hope to open it sometime
in the near future.
While this may still seem like an imbalance in that sword-wielders get the
sword first then get a chance at a second reward later I really looked towards
using the second quest to reward the non-sword wielders first and allowing a
few less functional items for sword wielders and those who would prefer items
based on role playing potential rather than just a new weapon or armor bit or
something.  With any luck that should bring things more into a sense of
balance.

"Slen, Lady Luck, Mistress of Chance, Bringer of Good Fortune...  the names
mortals call upon her are many.  She appears most often to mortals as a human
woman, short of hair and stature, with bright eyes and smile.  Her eyes are
often the color of newly-minted coins, and can change value according to her
mood or whim.  Alternatively, and more rarely, she appears with mischievous
green eyes.  Her favor is also said to be seen in a golden radiance, a coin,
newly minted and unexpectedly found, and a throw of the dice that leaves them
balanced on end.

Lady Luck is a goddess of whim and fancy...  she lends her favor to those in
need, though no run of luck lasts forever.  Slen has allied herself with Lonil
and the fight of Darkness, as she says there is no room for chance in
Temohpab's evil design.  She is said to be the spirit of boons and unexpected
windfalls, of chance and good fortune.  She claims she is foe to all of the
Dark Gods, though her followers seem to have a particular rivalry with those
of Lodar.

The symbol of Slen is a circle, divided in half.  One half is white, the other

"Sst'rasa"
"Sst'rasa is the goddess of the lizardfolk.  She is always depicted as a fierce
lizardwoman warrior, with a spear in one hand and claws bared in the other. 
Her scales encompass all the shades of green, while her spines and claws are
black as pitch.  Ruby eyes gleam brightly around the dark, slitted pupils of
the lizardman race.  Her green scales pattern themselves into a pattern of
interlocking diamonds.

Sst'rasa concerns herself only with her people, considering the other gods
foolish for wasting their time with inferior creatures and goals.  She is the
embodiment of the twin drives of passion and wisdom within the soul of all
lizardfolk.  Allying herself with none of the gods, she also considers none of
them her foes, save that they leave her people alone.  Most of the other gods
comply, however, their followers and races do not.  Sst'rasa has been known to
call her lizardfolk to battle any outside force entering their swamp, and the
city, Sos-kul.

Her symbol is an equilateral diamond, point up, usually in the red of her
eyes against a green background of her scales.  Any lizardfolk born with a
diamond pattern in their scales is considered lucky, and is often trained as a
cleric of Sst'rasa.

"Statements"
"This help file used to describe the structure of softcode programs on TFE, but

wish they hadn't done that, since \"help Functions\" is now incomplete and in
some cases incorrect.
-Severus

Oh, well, starting over below. This is a work in progress.
---
A TFE softcode program is a list of zero or more @estatements@n.  Execution of the
program starts with the first statement, and proceeds sequentially.  Execution
ceases when an \"end\", \"continue\", or \"return\" statement is encountered.  If
instead the end of the program is encountered, the program terminates as if an
\"end\" statement was executed.

Line breaks and white space are not considered part of any statement.  You can
put as many statements on each line of code as you like, or you can split one
statement across multiple lines at word or punctuation boundaries.

Statements may be grouped together in @eblocks@n, which are enclosed in braces {}.
A block is considered a single statement at the level in which it appears.

Certain statements may themselves contain other statements (or blocks) whose
execution they control.  Examples of this are the \"if/else\" and \"loop\"
statements.

Below is a list of all the statements accepted by the TFE softcode parser.


@CProgram termination@n

"@IDue to recent negotiations with the Dwarven Labour Union, a new
pricelist has been compiled for the building of Clan Strongholds.

@C*@nThe basic clan stronghold has been adjusted to three rooms, your clan
insignia, and a clan bank account (forthcoming).  Flat rate for this is
@C500k@n.

@C*@nA basic locked door and key come complimentary with your clan house. 
However for those of you who would like a little more secrecy, you can
add a secret entrance to your clan house.  The price of this added
feature will be between @C15k@n and @C50k@n depending on how elaborate
you want to get.

@C*@nFor those of you who would like a @Cfountain@n built in your Stronghold,
the charge is @C50k@n for materials and labour.

@C*@nThe cost for additional rooms will be @C200k@n per room.  If you want a
private room equipped with its own key required for entry, the price will be
@C250k@n.

@C*@nExtra room descriptions, such as pictures on the wall you can look
at, will cost you @C10k@n per description.

@C*@nExtra rooms leading up to a Stronghold will be priced at @C50k@n
for the first two rooms, then @C100k@n for each room after that.

@C*@nA bottomless kettle of soup in your stronghold will be @C30k@n for
stocking, labour, having the kettle fashioned, etc.

@C*@nActions, such as 'You smell a delicious aroma waft up from the kettle of
soup,' will cost @C15k@n per action.  More elaborate actions will be
negotiated at a cost from @C25k to 100k@n depending on how much work the
dwarves will need to do.

@C*@nSecret rooms will not be part of the basic three rooms.  To
create a secret room, you will be charged @C200k@n for an extra room as
well as an additional @C50k@n for the concealment of the door and hidden
lever.

@C*@nWhen you're relaxing in your new Stronghold or having an important
meeting, you may want to have a few tables, chairs, or couches for you and
your guests.  The price for a basic piece of furniture will be @C10k@n, but if
you want some exotic custom item, its going to be charged at a custom price. 
(Such as a throne or a dragon leather couch.)

@e*@nStorage rooms are available for your stronghold at the cost of @e200k@n
for the flag, with an additional purchase cost of @C200k@n for the room itself. 
These rooms save over crashes/reboots, and do not reset.  Items will stay
indefinitely either on the ground or in chests, should you choose to purchase
them.  Only one storage room is allowed per clan stronghold.

@C*@nChests can be placed in strongholds for @C100k@n each.  Items in chests will
reset when the room is reset unless the chest is placed in a Storage room.
The cost given is for a basic chest.  Special chests (fancier descriptions,
locks, etc) will cost more.

@C*@nOther flags that are allowed are arena and bank.  Only one bank is
allowed per stronghold at a cost of @C100k@n in addition to the cost of
@C200k@n for the room.  Having an arena will cost @C100k@n for the flag in
addition to the @C200k@n cost of the room.  Up to 9 rooms can be arena rooms.

If there is something you would like for your clan house that is not
listed here, please ask about it and it can be submitted to the Union for
consideration.  However, dwarves being the practical creatures they are,
try to keep it within the boundaries of realism.

Questions about clans and strongholds should be directed to Olah via request
or mudmail.
During Olah's leave of absence, Talis can be contacted as well.

"Swords"
"CREATED 12 June 2001, Phule

Historically, a generic 'sword' weight about 3 pounds.

German long swords were from 48 to 52 inches in length, with a grip long
enough for two hands but light enough to wield one-handed from horseback.

The blades became chewed up very quickly when fighting until about the
18th century or so, when they simply stopped sharpening them so much (\"a
thin bar of steel still does quite a bit of damage when you hit someone
very hard with it\").

My advice for the future of swords at TFE would be that when a builder
creates a sword, they should determine the metal, the length, width, and
thickness of the blade.  And perhaps a rating of craftsmanship, or
something or other, which has effects on the durability and balance of
the weapon.  However the sword's material and dimensions should determine
its weight, which in turn determines its damage along with current
condition of the blade.

The material determines the durability and expense of sharpening the
blade.

But perhaps the most important (to me) is improving swordplay in general. 
Very rarely would a skilled swordsman sit there and slash, slash, slash. 
Based on the dimensions of the blade (and its weight) and the swordsman's
skill, there should be thrusting, chopping, and, of course, the feint.

A skilled and intelligent swordsman would not keep hitting an opponent's
plate mail, either.  They would be aiming for a leg, arm, or other
exposed target.

A thrust wound of about two inches is usually fatal.  Slashing could do a
lot of collateral damage, such as severed muscles and broken bones.

"Syntax"
"This mud expects a syntax of input slightly different than most muds, which
can be confusing at first.  There are special characters that must be used in
conjunction with certain commands to either distinguish between items with
similar names, or do an action to multiple items.

There are many objects in the mud that have almost identical names.  For
example, if you have a short sword and a long sword in your inventory, typing
'look sword' might not look at the correct sword.  To look specifically at the
long sword, you would put a period in between the words of the object's name.
So, 'look long.sword' would look at the long sword.  If you wanted to @Ebuy@n a
soft leather jacket and not a hard leather jacket, you would type 'buy
soft.leather.jacket'.

Often, you will want to do something with many of the same type of item.  To
get, give, drop, @Esell@n, or @Ebuy@n many of the same type of item, you would use the
'*' character in front of the object's name, in the form x*<object>, x being
the number of that object.  For example, to drop 10 copper pieces, you would
type 'drop 10*copper'.  To buy 3 wooden shields, you would type 'buy
3*wooden.shield'.

The prefix 'all' is also used.  To sell all the skins in your inventory, you
would type 'sell all.skin'.  HOWEVER, 'all' can be used in two ways.  To get
all the objects from your bag, you would type 'get all bag'.  But, to get all
the bags in the room, you would type 'get all.bag'.

Finally, you can use a comma to group objects that don't have keywords in
common.  For example, if you want to drop a bronze sword and 5 pebbles, you
can use \"drop bronze.sword,5*pebble\".

"Taranth, Lady of Peace, is the Goddess of Peace and Healing.
Favoring the appearance of a young human maiden, blonde of hair and blue of

robes, tied with a belt of ivy.  The Lady of Peace is light of step, and every
sighting of her has reported her barefoot.

Taranth is the most pure-hearted of all of the gods, and is devoted only to
life.  Through healing, peace, and charity, she seeks the lives of all
creatures.  While sometimes called the Daughter of Lonil, it is unclear
whether or not she actually is.  Writings do often tell of her calling him
\"Father\" and the close bond they share, but this may be more to Taranth's
innocent and childlike outlook than blood relation.

In an alliance older than mortal writings and recollection, Kerog has declared
Taranth under his protection.  The Red Wind has even done battle against other
gods for protection of Taranth, allowing none to harm her.  The details and
origins of the agreement of the treaty between Kerog and Taranth are unclear,
but the results are thus: Kerog's followers are sworn to raise no hand to any
of Taranth's followers, and the healers of Taranth have sworn to heal both
sides of any war, regardless of motive or cause.  Such is the respect for life
that all who follow Taranth have, that they will heal even the most foul of
evil, as the believe that there is still goodness left within.  All life is
sacred, and all may return to the light.

Morkith considers himself foe to Taranth, but the Lady of Peace holds nothing
against him, and still grants the arts of healing to his practitioners.

Taranth's symbol is a dove wreathed in leaves of ivy.

Taranth accepts only those who hold life as primary in their heart as
followers.  She cannot understand what drives people to devote their lives
solely to war, so she does not accept warriors.  Thieves, for use of some of
their skills, are also not something she can condone within her flock, though
they will not be denied any healing.

"Temohpab"
"Temohpab, the Black Unicorn, the Peacock King, the Dark Lord, also known by
some as He Whose Name Should Not Be Spoken, is the god of evil and darkness. 
In legend, he appeared to his followers as a terrible knight clad in blackest
plate wielding a sword that was pain to even look upon.  The Black Unicorn is
his name from the creature he became, a terribly evil yet terribly beautiful
creature sister to Cynnis' chosen.  The Peacock King is a mysterious human
figure, fair of hair and countenance, with eyes of a green-blue over gold,
much like the eye of a peacock feather.

He is god of darkness and evil, and relishes both.  He does not seek the
destruction of all, however, as that province is more aptly Ulthi's.  He
wishes to cover the world with darkness, enslaving those who resist and
reforming it in his image.  He is Lord over the other evil gods, and chooses
not to share his domain with a Queen.  This causes division and strife among
the dark goddesses, which he enjoys immensely.  He is foe to the gods of
Light, and Meriada is often overwhelmed by his unbalancing ways.

His symbol is the Black Unicorn, rampant, unadorned.

He accepts any person not of the light as worshipper, though he prefers those
wholly given to darkness.

Allowed worshipper alignment: any non-good (LN, PN, CN, LE, NE, CE)

"The Child-Goddess"
"@IAnor was the most pure and innocent goddess of all, remaining a child even
as her sisters grew into adults.  Her voice was musical when she spoke and
even more beautiful when she sang and she brought things of great beauty into
the world.  The unicorn is among her creations and her help was employed in
helping the Twins create the beautiful elven nation.

@ILonil, the Radiance, swore to protect her innocent light from ever being
extinguished and cared for her just as her mother, Taranth, did.  He sought to
always make her happy, guarding over her and Freylia as they played together
and even joining in their childish games, always guarding against currupting
influences such as Temohpab and Ulthi.

@ITemohpab's corrupting gaze fell upon the Twins rather than sweet Anor,
though he succeeding in harming all three sisters when his plot to break the
unity of the Twins came to fruition.  While the Twins were scarred for what
they had done, Anor was scarred by what she had seen, the whole of her
innocence shattered completely.

@IThe last act of the Child-Goddess was to hide the last Temple of the Twins
from the world in hopes that the Twins would one day be reunited.  Aging
rapidly, Anor fled into the arms of her protector, weeping for all that had
been lost until she had no tears left and then fell into silent mourning.

@ILonil, horrified by his inability to keep his vow of protection, sought out
Meriada for a way to restore her innocence.  Meriada could not or would not
reverse the damage that had been done but gave Lonil a potion to prevent Anor
from dying of grief.  The potion would fog her memories and dull the pain,
erasing both the joys and horrors of her life.

@ILonil rushed back to the mourning Anor but already the Child was gone.  In
her place was a beautiful young woman whose eyes were emotionless and dead. 
He tried to coax her into drinking the potion but she had not the will to
move.  Seeing her aging before his eyes, Lonil tilted her head back and made
her swallow the potion, pouring it from his own mouth into hers.  As the
potion took effect, her aging slowed and then stopped.  Lonil mistakenly
swallowed a small amount of potion himself and the painful memory of what Anor
was once became faint in his mind, though his loyalty and love remained bright
in his heart.

@IThough no longer innocent, Anor gradually regained her loves of beauty and
music.  Taranth wished to nurture her daughter a second time but was just a
faint memory in Anor's mind and she chose to remain with Lonil.  Lonil fell in
love with the now grown Anor but remained simply her protector as she became
whole again.  In time, they became lovers and Anor bore him two children,
Ashallan and Slen.

"The Twins"
"@ITarafas, the Dawn Star, and Tarayla, the Evening Star, were once worshipped
as a pair.  The Twins were inseperable; they did everything together, and
never was there such a bond between two people as the one between Tarafas and
Tarayla.  They were virtually identical in appearance, mannerisms and even
their voices, save only the color of their hair: that of Tarafas had a slight
golden tinge, while Tarayla's bore the touch of silver.  This, of course, was
easily mutable to two beings so magically natured as they, and the Twins
enjoyed pulling pranks on other people, trading identities as easily as they
might a dress.  Together, they created the Llewyrr, the Children of the Light,
and with the assistance of the Child-Goddess, their sister Anor, blessed the
elven nation with great beauty and equally great capacity for love.  Also,
they instilled in their children the magics the Twins shared, and indeed, each
elf was gifted with this strong affinity for magic.  This time was known as
the Age of Magic, or the Age of the Twins.  During these days, magic was much
more common than it is today.  Virtually every living being bore some talent
for the arcane, and peace and prosperity ruled the land.

@ISuch harmonious times could not, however, last forever.  The indestructible
bond between Tarafas and Tarayla quickly drew the attention of the Corruptor,
Temohpab, who saw this as the ultimate test of his powers of destruction.  He
vowed to shatter strong affection between the Twins, and coerce one or both of
them to join his terrible evil.  Utilizing stealth granted him by Ulthi (who
in his madness was more than happy to grant Temohpab the power to bring chaos
to the union of the Twins), Temohpab seduced both of the sisters, allowing
neither to know that the other also had his attentions.  The sisters, thrilled
that each of them shared even the experience of finding a love, were certain
that life could not get better for either of them.  Little did they know just
how wrong they were.

@ITemohpab decided that the time had come to see just how thoroughly he could
destroy the Twins.  Using his magics to tint Tarafas' golden tresses with a
silvery hue, unbeknowst to her, he allowed Tarayla to come across him with her
sister.  Tarayla, shocked and confused, ran in horror from the scene of her
lover with her sister.  The first seeds of doubt and hatred had been planted
in her heart, something she had never before experienced in the sheltered,
blissful life of naivete the Twins had always led.  Tarayla felt pulled
irresistibly back to the place where Tarafas and Temohpab were, unwilling, yet
unable to resist the siren call of Temohpab's beckoning.

@IIt was then that she noticed her sister's silver hair.  Sudden anger flared
within her, searing her innocent soul with burning rage.  Tarayla watched,
horrified, until Tarafas left, and then ran to Temohpab, pleading to know why
he had betrayed her with her sister.  Temohpab, inwardly cackling with glee
that his horrid plot was coming to a head, swore to Tarayla that he had been
tricked by Tarafas, who had been masquerading as her sister.  Blinded by her
love of Temohpab, Tarayla accosted her sister, demanding to know why Tarafas
could be so cruel.  Tarafas, rightly denying any knowledge of what was going
on, pleaded with her sister to stop, to believe in her.

@INot truely reassured by Tarafas' pleas, yet unwilling to press things any
farther with the sister she so dearly loved, Tarayla backed down for the time
being.  An uneasy truce existed between the Twins for a while, though both had
cause to doubt the bond between them.  When it became apparent that Tarafas
was with child, however, the final tenuous thread between the Twins snapped. 
The inevitable occurred.  Tarayla, unable to stand the thought of her sister
bearing her lover's child, broke down in a fit of agony and rage.  Propelled
by the sinuous whispers in her mind, she went in a fury to Tarafas, and
attacked her.  Tarafas, too, was touched with anger, not only that her sister
would ever seek to harm her, but also because she, too, felt that she had been
betrayed in the matter of Temohpab's love.

@IThe Twins fought each other with all they had, each seeking to destroy the
other in the madness of their rage.  Storms of wild, chaotic magic flooded the
land, ripping it asunder as the battle of the Twins raged on.  At last, the
very land could suffer no more, and Meriada, who held all things arcane in his
hands, forced the Twins to cease their terrible fighting.  Though Meriada
restored the balance of the land as best he could, doing so pulled much of the
magical essence from the world, turning creatures and beings once very
mystical in nature were now suddenly rendered mundane, and were forced to
learn life without magic.  Many fragile creatures died, and many more were
forced into hiding to keep what little magical power they did have hidden from
the rest of the world.

@IBoth Twins were near death from their injuries and from sheer exhaustion. 
Their mother, Taranth did all she could to heal them, but knew that the most
important part of what had made up the Twins -- the mystical bond between them
-- could never be healed.  As a reminder of the horrible damage that had been
done that day, Taranth left each of the sisters with one scar on their
previously perfect faces: Tarafas' on the right cheek, and Tarayla's on the
left.  Tarafas was horrified at what had been done.  The thought that she had
been a part of the breaking of the world, not to mention the fact that she had
very nearly killed the twin she adored, left her in shock and agony.  She fled
the scene of their epic battle, weeping for all that once was, and never would
be again.  To her, the scar she now bore was an open wound, weeping for the
loss of her sister and her world.

@ITarayla, too, left what remained of the land which once the Twins had
created in tears.  Hers, however, were from the pain of not being able to
finish what she had started, and that her sister, once her best friend and now
her greatest hate, still drew breath.  Tarayla, now to be known as Shantara,
meaning Vengeance, wore the scar her mother had left to her as a twisted badge
of honor, yet one that will fester until she is able to complete her task of
killing her sister.  Shantara descended into Temohpab's darkness, forsaking
the land of light.  Those among the elves most loyal to her followed, choosing
to remain below the surface of the earth in night's constant embrace.  In
time, the Dyvie, or Children of Night, as they were now known, built the great
city of Meran'Aysa, the City of Twilight, whose location is now wiped from
mortal minds.

@IShantara bore Temohpab two children, first Morkith and then Rhiqua.  The
first, Morkith, was hideously warped by the fury and hatred that his mother
carried in her heart.  Unloved and unloveable, he shunned all but his younger
sister, Rhiqua, who he felt could be of use to him.  Morkith turned his innate
talent for the mystic arts into an intense study of the undead and demons,
making his ultimate goal the destruction of everything upon the earth. 
Rhiqua, beautiful and destructive, became known as the Child of Hate, poisoned
by her mother's constant venom into hating almost all of creation, seeking to
cleanse the world in a torrent of fire.

@IAfter the epic battle with her sister, Tarafas sought complete seclusion
from the world.  Indeed, she withdrew herself so completely from the mortal
realm that she gradually faded from mention by name, and seemed remembered
only by her title, the Dawnstar.  The child she bore was a girl, whom Dawnstar
named Cynnis.  She taught the child to love the woodlands and the wild things
that dwelt within.  Cynnis grew to be the protector of the forests, and in
fact, all of nature.  In time, the Llewyrr came to hold her in almost the same
regard they had once given to Tarafas, now faded in their memory.

"tips"
"TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to The Forest's Edge
get their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you
start your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!
@I
@I Law 1: Self-Preservation.  Set your @bwimpy@n.  What \"wimpy\" does is
engage character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of
course) is beaten down to 8 hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't
simply rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  @bFlee@ning (typing
\"flee\") will also get you to protect your tender hide.
@I
@I Law 2: Con before kill.  Before you even *think* about attacking a
mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To do this type \"con
monster_name\" -- perhaps \"con goat\" -- and hit enter.  This will make
your character \"consider\" his/her chance of success against that monster
in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you come accross, type \"kill
monster_name.\" 
@I
@I Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were
feeling hungry or thirsty.  Here at TFE you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers
and brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food
can be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type \"eat bread\" or \"drink fountain\" to eat and drink.
@I
@I Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type \"skin corpse\"
after the fight has ended.
@I
@I Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
at TFE, you need to @bpractice@n and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you
much good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters)
have been around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type \"prac\" in
a room where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught
there, a list of skills will appear.  Type \"prac skill_name\" to train in
that skill.  Type \"abil\" to see a list of your abilites which can be
learned.
@I
@I
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Happy MUDding!!

"Tomb of the House Nercress"
"The House Nercress ruled from mountain to sea near the end of the last
age.  Allied with the goodly silver dragons, the House Nercress ruled
with wisdom, goodness, and justice.  A temple housing the dragons was
constructed high upon one of the granite mountains, beside the ancient
tombs of the royal house.

Lord Necress had seen his kingdom grow and prosper, but he feared for the
future.  He had no sons, only the daughter which was the light of his
life.  In her, he saw the glimmering beauty of his wife, who had died
during childbirth.  He feared for her, and for his people, for the war of
succession to come at his death would be bloody indeed, if peace could
not be insured.

But worse still was the fate which befell the House Nercress.  Usurpers,
seeking the throne, kidnapped the Lord's only joy and stole away to their
dark keep.  Leading a flight of gleaming silver, Lord Nercress stormed

@C[Chiiron]
@W[Humans: Secomber]@n

The city of Chiiron lies a few miles west of the Sea of Stars.  This city
is the primary home of the humans in this region of the realms.  Although
it started out as a trading post Chiiron quickly grew to be a thriving
community and welcomes all light races.  Chiiron is also the starting
point for many new and brave adventurers.


@C[Medienne]@n
@W[Humans: Secomber]@n

Medienne was once a thriving merchant community until a long and deadly
war with the neighboring elves ravaged the city.  The city has slowly began
to rebuild itself to the former glory but is also in constant danger due to
the nearby forest and graveyard filled with many dangerous monsters.
Despite its hazardous locale many adventurers call Medienne home due to its
tolerance for both light and dark races.


@C[Darkhaven]@n
@W[Dark Races]@n

Darkhaven is a small underground city which is home to the evil beings of
the realms.  Many humans, vyans, ogres, trolls and the like call this city
home due to its hidden location.  No light race has ever ventured into
the city and returned to tell what lies inside it.


@C[Pennan]@n
@W[Humans: Secomber]@n

Pennan is a very large farming community a few miles west of Chiiron.  Surrounding
the city are lush, green hills which the farmers of the town allow their
herds to graze.  Pennan is under constant attack by the many monsters which live
dangerous close to its walls.  Pennan is known for their superior armorsmiths
which have setup shops and make finely crafted armors.


@C[Kha-Da]@n
@W[Dwarves: Khedrun]@n

Nestled deep inside the Cairn Mountains lies the dwarven stronghold known
as Kha-Da.  The city is home to superior dwarven armorsmiths and weaponsmiths.
A few dwarves call this city home as is it so isolated that it rarely
has any trouble from the nearby monsters.


@C[Brithbarad]@n
@W[Orcs: Azak]@n

Brithbarad is a large orcish outpost several miles north of the Black Hills.
The outpost is surrounded by grassy plain regions home to several varieties
of dangerous animals.  Many dark races as well as orcs call this home due to
the tolerance the orcs have for other races which someday may be
needed as allies.


@C[Denab-Knur]@n
@W[Ogres: Karse]@n

Located in the side of the Dragonspire Mountains, this ruined town was once
a thriving human settlement.  After several brutal battles the ogres of the
land slaughtered all the townsfolk and claimed it as their own.  Since than it
has become more decrepit and ruined.  The main home for ogres, the town also
holds a tolerance for other dark races.


@C[Vaasa]@n
@W[Elves: Eleint]@n

Little is known about this elven city for only a selected few of non-elven heritage
have ventured into it.  Those that have seen it have come back to tell about
its beautiful view overlooking the Vaasa and its marvelous construction.
Hidden among the trees only elves seem to be able to find its extremely well
hidden locale.


@C[Sos-Kul]@n
@W[Lizardmen: Stahl]@n

Most would call the Kss'sk swamp a dark, damp creation where only monsters
and leeches dwell, but to the lizardmen, the swamp is known as home.  Nestled
within the swamp is the lizardman city of Sos-Kul.  Although not as advanced
as other races, the lizardmen pride themselves upon being able to live
in such an unforgiving environment.  The city lies far to the south and the path
is dangerous to all but the most experienced adventurer.


@C[Voaleth]
@W[Dark Races]@n

Voaleth is an underground city which is home to many of the dark races of the
realms.  Many vyans, ogres, trolls, orcs, goblins and even a few humans of
darker intent call this city home.  Its location is hidden but is rumored to
dwell somewhere deep in the heart of the Dragonspire mountains.


@C[Ent'moot]
@W[Ents: Ueschel]@n

Also known as the city without walls, many consider Ent'moot little more than
a gathering of Ents in one location.  Ents themselves view it as sacred ground
given into their guardianship from time before memory.  Ent'moot is located in
the Vaasa overlooking one of the widest stretches of the great Windlass river.


@C[Narak]
@W[Humans: Independent]@n

A city founded in the heart of the Naraki desert, its people are fiercely
independent from other nations.  Narak has weathered many hardships to become
the strong people that it now is, home to a thousand wonders and a thousand
hidden dangers.  Many come from all places across the realm to sample this
mysterious city's delights.

"Trap Construction"
"Traps are special objects, rather than acodes.  To construct a trap,
oedit new as any other object.

Set the object type to trap, then set the various fields such as cost and
repair as you see fit.  Remember to write a description, as many traps
can be acquired and used by players.

Next, create an object program using 'opedit new'.  Use 'opset trigger
use' to set the opcode to the use trigger, which is necessary for the
trap to function correctly.

From there, it is a simple matter of constructing the opcode to display
the appropriate messages and cause the desired damage or effect.

One important consideration is whether the trap will hit only once or
will hit again and again until disarmed.  Although this is left to the
builder's discretion, the vast majority of traps will hit only once and
then will be inactive.  Traps that hit repeatedly should be both very
rare and used only in special occasions.  To have a trap hit only once,
the last line of the opcode should be - 

junk_obj( obj, 1 );

This removes the trap object from the room and thus, in effect,
deactivates the trap.

To have the trap strike repeatedly, simply omit this line.  For examples
of traps and their code, see 'ofind -t trap'.  Some examples of basic
traps are the poison needle (vnum 130), and the magic missile trap (vnum
3406).

"Trap Placement"
"Traps are special objects that reset inside container objects and that
can be disarmed by a thief who is sufficiently learned in the Untrap
skill.

To place a trap in an object:

- Reset the object, for example a chest, in the room.
- Type 'reset # +c' to flag the object as a container.  The # is
whichever reset slot the container uses.  For example, if a chest is the
first reset in a room, the command would be 'reset 1 +c', if it is the
third reset 'reset 3 +c', and so on.
- Oload and reset the trap you wish to use.  Various traps can be found
using the 'ofind -t trap' command.
- Flag the trap as being inside the container using the 'reset # +i' command.
- Set the chance for the trap to reset.  (See 'help reset' for
information on this).  For example, if a trap is reset at 10%, then the
chest in which it resets has a 10%, or 1-in-10 chance of being trapped.

"@GAverage Statistics for Trolls@n

Height: males about 6'4\" - 7'4\"
        females: about 6'6\" - 7'6\"

Hair: Swamp trolls tend to have black hair, not always on their
      head.  What hair grows on them is either greasy or coarse.
      Ice trolls of the north have white hair, with at least
      more on their head than elsewhere.

Eyes: All trolls have beady little black or red eyes with very small pupils.
      Essentially there is no iris, just the red or black around the pupil.
Affiliation: trolls are a dark race.

Appearance: Trolls have green skin in a variety of hues (though none are
what would be called vibrant, verdant, bright, neon, or electric green). 
They are often warty or have cancerous appearing growths, though these do
not seem to affect their health negatively in any way, rather it appears
to be an excess product of their ability to regenerate.  Trolls almost
never have any scars, as they heal so incredibly well.  For a race that
is typically foul, corrupt and evil they have incongruous gift of
incredible regeneration but it comes at the cost of a never-ending hunger.

Ice trolls tend to have duller, paler skin that is typically dry.  Their
hair is coarse and bushy.  Swamp trolls tend to have darker shades of
skin and greasy, sparse hair.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Troll@n

Trolls are known to be big, slow lumbering behemoths whose sole goal in
life is to feed their never-ending appetite.  Fortunately for them, just
about anything short of stone is considered edible and their metabolisms
are quite happy to oblige in that regard.  While an uprooted shrub or
forgotten bit of clothing makes an adequate snack, the best food is
something you just killed yourself.  While some trolls have finally
managed to figure out that skinning an animal might provide fur you can
sell for even better tasting meat, most still prefer to just eat the
corpse outright.  After all, not much tastes better than a fresh kill
whose blood is still warm.  The fact that you just killed it yourself,
somewhat sating an almost equal appetite for destruction is just spice for
the flavoring.

Two varieties of troll have developed in the realm, though both races
share a few common characteristics.  Hunger, the ability to heal, and a
complete loathing for sunlight.  All trolls prefer the dark of a nice
cave to the painful light of day.  They also all share a deep-rooted fear
of fire as it has the ability to harm them and is about the only thing
likely to scar a troll.

Swamp trolls are the more common variety when seen at all, tending
towards solitary life.  They are fairly anti-social, even among their own
kind and like to live under the exposed roots of large swamp trees or
under bridges.  They are quick to anger, quick to kill things, and
insufferably monotonous.  They are poor conversationalists with
communication skills often extending at best to grunts and simple
gestures.

Ice trolls, also called northern trolls, are found primarily in the upper
Cairn mountains and, infrequently, in the Dragonspire mountains.  Unlike
their swampland cousins, they share a common social structure and tend to
live in small familial groups in the mountain caves.  Though they still
share a fairly low level of communication, they are at least known to
have a limited vocabulary making them seem leaps and bounds ahead of
their swampland cousins.  Ice trolls tend to be more intellectually
advanced, which still isn't saying much, heartier in survival, but
smaller, weaker and less brutal in comparison to their cousins.


@yRacial Relations:@n
Trolls are typically a solitary breed, though they rarely fight with
other trolls when they do meet.

Vyans are considered untrustworthy schemers, though useful allies in dire
circumstances.

Goblins are only useful as lackeys and servants.

Orcs make useful allies and fair-to-middling hunting partners
particularly when the quarry is elves.

Short of other trolls, ogres make the best companions as they share the
trolls' lack of love for conversation and their love of carnage.

Elves, dwarves, gnomes, and halflings are despised as legions of light
and order as much as their tendency to get in the way of a good meal. 
Fortunately they, themselves make excellent meals.  Provided they didn't
bring fire, one meal is as good as another.

The best thing about ents is provoking them.  After all, they look so
much like trolls that they must be related.  Trolls just can't figure out
what's wrong with them that they serve light and goodness.  As they are
typically slow to anger, trolls get great mirth out of trying to convert
ents.  A lack of vocabulary simply means this usually take the form of
offering ents ample bloody meals, which they invariable refuse.  The look
of tormented sadness in their eyes as they consider the harm you caused
to living beings in obtaining the meat is about as much fun to see as it
is getting the meat in the first place.

The best thing about humans is the fact that they keep building bridge to
hide under and most of them are too weak to harm a troll.  The end result
is that they build trolls fabulous homes then pay them to walk over them
and if they refuse to pay they try to cross anyway making a never-ending
supply of meals that come to your very own front door.  The occasional
human turns to the dark side and makes for an interesting hunting
companion as they can be quite inventive in their destructiveness.

Max damage, is for the damage dice.  Damroll represents the dam
roll modifer for the weapon.  For every damroll you take away from
a monk weapon from the table you made add a 5% hit special.  (thus
a level 80 monk weapon with 0 damroll modifer could have a 20% hit
special.

"Undead"
"@b Undead should all have the following attributes: @n 

Sleep_resist on, Poison resistance 100% and poison resist on,
Has eyes off - can't blind undead, Mind resistance set to 100%.  Zero
regen on for lower level undead mobs, on (allows players the chance to
reraise undead by investing more energy in trade for the fact that undead
don't heal), wimpy off (they don't fear damage, won't flee).  include
Undead in keywords.  Marmor should be according to logic.
  
@CZombies@n:  fill zombie slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)
          fill skeleton slot with a skeleton (you can always rot the flesh off)
For zombies attached to mobs, set their level = 1/2 donor mob, however,
set the stas of said zombie to those of a mob = 1/3 the donor mob.
Set to slow (unless donor mob was fast), has_eyes on (they have them),
Infravision on (low_level sense life).  They are the lowest level of
undead and not immune to much, so low level fire / cold resist, slightly
better electrical resist.
     Damage done by zombie should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob.  (If donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to
less damage or maybe just two claw attacks, etc.  Use your best judgment).
Often it is easiest to start by just dropping any special attack the
donor mob had.
   
@CSkeletons@n:  dont fill zombie slot, no flesh/muscle parts left.
            fill skeleton slot with their own mnum (can be reraised)
For skeletons attached to mobs, level = level of donor mob, however, the
stats of said skeleton should = 2/3 stats of the donor mob.
don't set to fast unless donor mob was fast to begin with.  Has_eyes off,
Infravision / See_invisible on (effectively sense life).  Slightly better
defense of fire/cold/elec then similar zombie type.
     Damage done by skeleton should follow standard mob damage for a mob
of its level.  The form the damage takes should roughly follow that of
the donor mob. (If the donor mob had 2 claw attacks and a bite, downsize to
less damage or maybe just two claw atttacks, etc.  Use your best judgement).
Those with immaterial or ethereal forms (ghosts, banshees, etc)
should have the mflag ghost and mflag no_bash set.

"Vyans"
"@GAverage Statistics for Vyans@n

Height: males about 4'8\" - 5'8\"
        females about 4'6\" - 5'6\"

Hair: typically straight.  Pale (white/gray/silver) to Black.
      Extremely rarely brown or blond.  Vyans have no facial hair.

Eyes: Almond-shaped / up-slanted eyes in colors of primarily
      violet or amber.  Other colors, such as brilliant blues or
      anything from gray to black are also not uncommon.

Affiliation: vyans are a dark race.

Appearance: Vyans look much like humans, though they generally have a smaller,
slenderer build than humans.  Vyans tend to have smooth unblemished skin
ranging from midnight black to pale, wan colors and ashen castes.  The vyan
with the healthy glow of sun-burnished skin is almost completely unheard of. 
Despite their appearance as a result of living primarily underground for
countless centuries, vyans tend to possess a beauty to equal that of elves. 
There dark beauty has drawn in many an unwary victim who later fell pray to
whatever schemes the vyans were planning.  You probably won't see wrinkles on
a vyan before they reach at least a good 500-600 years old, and even then it
would be very faint and hard to notice for a few hundred more years.  Vyan
hair typically does not turn gray or white from age until they reach about a
thousand years of age, if at all.
Like elves, vyans have upswept, pointed ears.


@GOptional Advice on Role Playing a Vyan@n

Vyans are a haughty race, indeed perhaps the most haughty of all races. 
They will refer to themselves as vyans or simply The People, as they view
any other race as chattel to be used or destroyed at a whim and with no
more remorse than if they were objects.  They believe it is their
divinely given right to rule and they very nearly manage to succeed.

If playing a normal vyan, it might be suggested that you imply that you,
or another vyan, is the undisputed leader of any group you are in.  If
anyone disputes this you should probably follow them into the nearest
player-killing zone and kill them or have a loyal minion kill them in your
name.  After all, it is divine will that ordains your sovereignty.  Just
don't confuse leadership with tanking (being the one who takes all the
hits in a group).  That's what sturdy minions are for, preferably ogres
and trolls, who are just big dumb brutes adapted to taking such beatings.

Vyans hate to be called dark elves.  Once, long ago the elves and the
vyans may have shared common ancestors, but the elves have proven to be
weak fool relying on the good will of life where they should accept their
role as an elder race along with the vyans and rule through power.  Long
wars have developed due to the rift in elven and vyan philosophies and
there is no hope of a peace ever developing now.  To call a vyan an elf,
even a dark elf, is to imply that they are weak and foolish.  Ideally
only other vyans should be permitted to even speak to you, however, on
those occasions when a minion must speak with you they should refer to
you as master.


@yRacial Relations:@n
As the only true people, vyans view every other race with some measure of
contempt, though some more than others.

Trolls, Ogres and Orcs make good minions and cannon fodder in a fight.

Goblins are a nuisance best destroyed unless you have raised them from
birth to be subservient slaves.

Humans, while occasionally producing a few dark-minded folk who can serve
as good as ogres, trolls and orcs, are primarily still pretty useless and
are better destroyed than ignored before they get lucky and find some way
to cause trouble.

Dwarves, halflings, and gnomes typically serve the force of light and
should be destroyed outright as they are meddlesome nuisances.

Elves have become the bane of vyan existence.  These close cousins embody
all the weak, pathetic ideas that the vyan nation finally overcame and
cast off.  An unending war has raged for countless centuries between
these two races that embody the paths of light and dark.

Ents, as servants of the light and close allies of elves are hated, but
only about as much as one could be said to hate a dangerous animal.  They
are dangerous, but they aren't really people.  If not for the fact they
aid the elves much in the same way ogres and trolls are of use to the
vyans, ents would be a concern that could be left off for a later, more
convenient date.

The wait command allows you to insert a pause of up to 30 seconds between
queued commands.  Non-queued commands will bypass the wait, and disrupting
commands (such as \"flee\") will cancel the wait and everything else in the
command queue.

Note that, due to network buffering, the delay may appear to be up to 2
seconds longer than specified.  However, the command is actually executed at
the correct time, whether you see it immediately or not.

none.

@CDESCRIPTION@n

Pauses execution of the code.  Currently, each \"tick\" is 2 seconds of real
time, corresponding to 20 seconds of imaginary \"MUD time\".

After a wait, it's always a good idea to check variables for validity before
using them.  For example:

act_tochar( #before_wait, ch );
wait( 5 );
if( ch && char_in_room( ch, room ) )
  act_tochar( #after_wait, ch );

In the code above, the if statement checks if ch is still valid, and that ch
is still in the room.

@b@RNOTE: at this time the wait() function does not operate correctly within
if/else blocks, you will have to structure your code so that the wait
statement falls outside of any blocks.  

@G// This code won'k properly.@n
@G// It will exit at the '}' if the wait is executed.@n
if( is_open( room, east ) ) {
  wait( 2 );
  act_tochar( #char, ch );
  }
act_tochar( #either, ch );

@G// This code will..@n
if( !is_open( room, east ) ) {
  act_tochar( #either, ch );
  end;
}
wait( 2 );
act_tochar( #char, ch );
act_tochar( #either, ch );

@b@RANOTHER NOTE: the \"continue\" statement will not work after a wait().@n
The wait() function call, in effect, causes an \"end\" to occur.  In an acode,
the command that caused the program to execute will stop.  After the wait, a
\"continue\" will have no effect, since the command has already been completed.

@CEnhancing your character@n
  
Starting out you'll have a few skills.  Some weapon proficiencies, some
non-weapon skills, and the ability to understand primal language (what
imms use so everyone can understand them) and to speak and understand
humanic (the human language).  You can see what skills you have already
and what you can currently learn by using the @CAbility@n command. 
Typing @Cabil weapon@n will show you what weapon skills you can learn at
this level, which ones you already know (to what proficiency level, max
of 10) and how much it costs per increase in level.
Typing @Cabil@n alone will show you what other ability types you can
check for.  In this case: @Cabil weapon@n, @Cabil language@n, and @Cabil
physical@n.  We can skip spells for now as warriors do not have access to
spells.  Only spell casters like clerics and mages or specialized
warriors like paladins and rangers can learn spells.
    
As a starting warrior you know a little bit about using daggers.  You
could wield a sword right now, but it wouldn't be very effective.  We can
see, by checking abil weapon, that to learn to use a sword (typically
much more efficient for killing things than a dagger) you would need to
learn the prerequisite of dagger to level 5.  We can do this in one of
two ways.
First, you can use @Cpractice points@n to have someone train you to use a
dagger better.  Once your dagger skill reaches level 5, you can then
begin learning sword skill.
Second, you can learn through experience.  By wielding a dagger in
combat, there is a random chance you will either improve in dagger skill
or learn something from it and gain a practice point for future use.  For
some skills (primarily spells) the check is made whenever the skill or
spell is used.  For things in almost constant use, like weapon skills or
searching or hiding, the check is made periodically.  If you used the
skill since last check, then a check is made to see if you randomly
improve or not.  What determines success?  Intelligence and Wisdom both
contribute in some ways to how easily you improve.  Having a low
intelligence or wisdom will decrease your abilities in the long run. 
Having a high intelligence and wisdom will earn you more practices and
improvements over time, but it will come at the cost of other skills like
strength, endurance and dexterity.  the skill primarily used for fighting.

"Weapons and Armor"
"This help file describes the weapons vs armor table that will be
implemented.  Weapons will have different affects on humanoid armored
creatures from now on.  Those affects also depend on the armor.

See Weap Classes for details on what each weapon should do damage-wise.

There are several different types of armor.  Below is a table of what
should work well against what, and in what fashion it will work.

The formula for damage would then work as such: On any attack, for say
Punching vs.  Hard Leather, there is a (1-2/3) = 1/3 chance that the
punch will do no harm to the character.  In addition, the damage done
when it does work is 2/3 of the damage the attack would normally do.

The armor system would in this instance require something of an overhaul. 
In addition, the attack() system would require an overhaul as well.
In this case, damage types would then be more akin to attack_punch,
attack_slash, etc.

Pad = Padded
Sof = Soft Leather
Har = Hard Leather
Stu = Studded Leather
Ban = Banded Mail

@cwear <object>@n : Wear <object> on your body.

@GDESCRIPTION:@n
Whenever you want to use a piece of equipment, you need to @gwear@n it. 
Sometimes, however, you might not be able to wear a certain piece of equipment
for various reasons.  The fact that clerics cannot wield a weapon with a blade
may be keeping you from that sword you just won, or the fact that you're
wearing too many layers of armor to put on another breastplate.  Sometimes,
however, the equipment you're trying to wear might just be a bit too strong
for you to use properly.  When this happens, you'll get the message \"You can't
cope with <item>.\" Other times, you may sense aversion from an object.  This
means that there is an aura within the object that prevents people with
certain characteristics from using it.  For example, a holy rod of goodness
and light wouldn't be likely to allow an evil being to use its power.  Also,
paladins will blatantly refuse to use any weapon that they consider to be
dishonorable.  Once you've adventured the land for a while, you'll begin to
realize the affects that your equipment can have on you, and how to maximize
their effects.

"Wear Locations"
"This help file provides a listing of wear locations.
CREATED ON 8 JUNE 2001

take, finger, neck, body, head, legs, feet, hands, arms, waist, wrist,
right.hand, left.hand 

The 'take' location means the item can be placed into the inventory.
The 'right.hand' is similar to 'main weapon'.
The 'left.hand' is similar to 'off hand', also shield, torch, etc..

LAYERS

All objects have bottom, under, base, over, and top layer flags.

One of these flags must be set for the item to be worn.

If multiple flags are set, more than ONE of these items can be worn, ONE
in each location.  (note this is different than I remember, which used to
be TWO in each location.  This way makes MUCH more sense.) 

ADDITITVE

The 'additive' oflag determined if wearing multiple identical items keep
adding their magic affects.

MORE ON LAYERS

For rings and bracelets, remember, that this applies individually to EACH
finger or wrist.  (you can wear an item in each wear location on both
left and right side).

For right.hand and left.hand the ONLY layer flag which should be used is
BASE, as it does not make any sense whatsoever to be holding more than
one item in each hand.

WHERE SHOULD MY ITEM GO?

FINGER: rings and wedding bands, etc.  Magic items should have ONLY the
'base' layer flag.  This means that characters may only wear at MOST TWO
magical rings at the same time.  Non-magic trinkets should user the
'bottom' layer flag ONLY.  This allows characters to where TWO trinket
rings and enables them to remove all magic rings independantly of trinket
rings.  No other use of any other layer for the finger location is
approved for mortal use.

NECK: necklaces, medallions, charms, pendants, collars, scarves, etc. 
Magic necklaces, medallions, and charms should have ONLY the 'base' layer. 
Trinkets use the 'bottom' layer ONLY.  Collars and scarfs, etc, use the
'top' layer.  No other use of neck layers is allowed.

BODY: cloaks, armor, shirts, armor pads, etc.  All base armor should have
the 'base' layer ONLY.  This applies to plate mail, leather armor, chain
mail, robes, shirts of type armor, etc, etc.  All cloaks and 'trinket'
(read: non-magic and very cloaklike) robes use the 'over' layer ONLY. 
This does not apply to robes of type armor!  The 'top' layer is reserved
for backpacks.  The 'under' layer is to be used for armor pads, 'trinket'
(read: non-magic, for dress only) shirts and dresses, etc.  The use of
the 'bottom' layer is prohibited at this time.

HEAD: helms, chain coifs, turbans, masks, etc.  All helms, hats, and
armor crowns should have the 'base' layer ONLY.  Coifs and circlets
should have the 'under' layer only.  Arming caps should have the 'bottom'
layer ONLY.  Trinket crowns (read: non-magical, status only) should have
the 'over' layer ONLY.  Headdresses, etc, have the 'top' layer.  For now
(this is hoping to change), earrings, feathers, etc, must share the 'top'
layer with headdresses.

LEGS: pants, skirts, leggings, kilts, underwear, etc.  Underwear is
reserved for the 'bottom' layer (pun intended).  Leg armor pads are for
the 'under' layer, also 'trinket' pants.  The 'base' layer is for armor,
such as pants of type armor, leggings, leg plates, etc.  The 'over' layer
is for 'trinket' skirts and kilts.  There is no intended use for the
'top' layer.

FEET: anklets, socks, shoes, spurs, sandals, boots, etc.  The 'bottom'
layer is for anklets.  The 'under' layer s for socks.  The 'base' layer
is for ALL shoes, boots, sandals, etc, etc.  The 'over' layer is for
spurs.  There is no use for the 'top' layer (no pennyloafers).

HANDS: gloves, manacles, gauntlets, etc.  All gloves and gauntlets go in
the 'base' layer.  Manacles, chains, etc go to the 'over' layer.  No
other layers are assigned.

ARMS: sleeves, arm tattoos, arm guards, over-the-shoulder bags (quivers,
etc) etc.  The 'bottom' is for 'trinket' bands, brands (permanent),
tattoos (permanent), etc.  The 'under' layer is for armor pads.  The
'base' layer is for all sleeves, arm guards, arm plates, arm armor, etc. 
The 'over' layer is for over-the-shoulder items like quivers and satchels.

WAIST: belts, girdles and etc.  All items go on 'base' layer.  An
exception is that keyrings may be clipped to an invisible belt on the
'top' layer.

WRIST: bracelets, bracers, wrist bands, etc.  The 'base' layer is for all
bracers.  The 'over' layer is for all bracelets (magic or trinket).

EAR: earrings ('base'), feathers ('top').
HAIR: ribbons, barettes, pins.  (all 'base').
(note that currently both ear and hair share the 'top' layer on head.)

Whisper is used to communicate to another player in the same room as you
are and uses the language you are currently speaking.  Only the person
you whispered to will see what you just said, but others in the room will
see that you just whispered something to that person.

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Whistling is how you attract your pets.  If they are within a certain
range, they will hear your summons and respond, moving toward you to the
best of their abilities and movement.  Due to their unique racial
characteristics, Lizardmen are unable to whistle and must therefore find
some other means of communicating with their pets.

category lists people who you are introduced to but not @cbefriended@n.  The
@cunknown@n category lists people who you have not been introduced to.  Each

wimpy : list current wimpy settings
wimpy <field> <value> : sets your wimpy to kick in at a value
wimpy <field> 0 : turns off that field

@C@bDESCRIPTION@n

Wimpy causes you to automatically react when your hit points go below a
certain level.  The value represents a percentage of your hit points.  To
determine the exact number of hit points at which your wimpy will take effect,
multiply your maximum hit points by the percentage, then discard any
fractional part.

You will attempt to flee automatically, so remember to turn it off at the
appropriate times or it could get you into more trouble than the good it
may do.

Note that wimpy is @bNOT@n failsafe, and comes with no ironclad
guarantees, but it's usually better than nothing.

The available fields are Flee, Blink, Pray and Recall.  When your hit points
go below the value of a field, you will attempt to either flee, recite a
scroll of recall if you have one, pray to your diety, or cast the spell
'blink' if you are a mage.  Again, this is not failsafe, so be warned.

Wimpy pray values above 33% provide no additional protection; you will not
automatically pray unless you have no more than 33% of your hp when not
fighting, or 25% when fighting, since your deity would always refuse to help
you anyway.

Though feared for the swathe of destruction they can cause, slowly devouring
tree after tree, many elves have taken it upon themselves to champion the
cause of the woodworm's downfall.  With vigilance and constant hard work, the
elves have managed to keep the depredations of the woodworms at a standstill.
Should you seek to join these noble guardians of the woods in defending the
Vaasa, then ask any Llewyrr in that vast woods, and they will probably be able

This is by no means an accurate or to scale representation of this

The biggest misrepresentation this map gives is the illusion that Human

than the other regions. This is simply not the case - we simply have not
completed the other regions and cannot provide a similar level of detail.

"Xiroce"
"Xiroce, the Lord of the Dead, is one of the Ebon Triumvirate.  There is no
definitive record of Xiroce actually appearing to a living being, but his
followers claim that he is insubstantial, as a phantasm.  The spectral form is
said to be that of a male, dressed in fine clothes without ostentation or
ornementation.  It is impossible to tell what shade or hue his hair or eyes
were to have been in life.

The Lord of the Dead is ward of all the souls that have passed Morr's
transition and not returned for Morkith's unlife.  He despises all that is
alive, though waits with an unearthly patience, knowing that in time, they
will all become his.  Xiroce seethes over the concept of Morr determining when
souls come to him, and has been lusting and plotting after his brother's power
for millennia.  The gods of Light shun him, but he doesn't seem to mind.  He
answers all rejoinders in that form with \"Even gods may die, and become mine.\"
It has never been recorded to happen, but this statement is often uttered by
his faithful.

His symbol is the nightsheart flower, a particular flower that only blooms in
soil that is above a corpse and has not seen the sun since the corpse was
buried.  It is a flower with velvety black petals that seem to draw in the
light, with no blemish or splash of any color.  The center seems even darker,
though that may be a trick of the light or artistry.

Xiroce will accept followers of any belief save that of life, for he cannot
abide those who hold life with any sanctity.

Allowed worshipper alignment:  Any non-good (LN, PN, CN, LE, NE, CE)
