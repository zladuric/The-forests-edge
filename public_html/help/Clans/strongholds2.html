  Due to recent negotiations with the Dwarven Labour Union, a new
pricelist has been compiled for the building of Clan Strongholds.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>The basic clan stronghold has been adjusted to three rooms, your clan
insignia, and a clan bank account (forthcoming).  Flat rate for this is
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">500k</span>.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>A basic locked door and key come complimentary with your clan house. 
However for those of you who would like a little more secrecy, you can
add a secret entrance to your clan house.  The price of this added
feature will be between <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">15k</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">50k</span> depending on how elaborate
you want to get.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>For those of you who would like a <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">fountain</span> built in your Stronghold,
the charge is <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">50k</span> for materials and labour.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>The cost for additional rooms will be <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">200k</span> per room.  If you want a
private room equipped with its own key required for entry, the price will be
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">250k</span>.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Extra room descriptions, such as pictures on the wall you can look
at, will cost you <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">10k</span> per description.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Extra rooms leading up to a Stronghold will be priced at <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">50k</span>
for the first two rooms, then <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">100k</span> for each room after that.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>A bottomless kettle of soup in your stronghold will be <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">30k</span> for
stocking, labour, having the kettle fashioned, etc.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Actions, such as 'You smell a delicious aroma waft up from the kettle of
soup,' will cost <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">15k</span> per action.  More elaborate actions will be
negotiated at a cost from <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">25k to 100k</span> depending on how much work the
dwarves will need to do.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Secret rooms will not be part of the basic three rooms.  To
create a secret room, you will be charged <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">200k</span> for an extra room as
well as an additional <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">50k</span> for the concealment of the door and hidden
lever.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>When you're relaxing in your new Stronghold or having an important
meeting, you may want to have a few tables, chairs, or couches for you and
your guests.  The price for a basic piece of furniture will be <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">10k</span>, but if
you want some exotic custom item, its going to be charged at a custom price. 
(Such as a throne or a dragon leather couch.)

<span style="font-weight:bold;">*</span>Storage rooms are available for your stronghold at the cost of <span style="font-weight:bold;">200k</span>
for the flag, with an additional purchase cost of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">200k</span> for the room itself. 
These rooms save over crashes/reboots, and do not reset.  Items will stay
indefinitely either on the ground or in chests, should you choose to purchase
them.  Only one storage room is allowed per clan stronghold.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Chests can be placed in strongholds for <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">100k</span> each.  Items in chests will
reset when the room is reset unless the chest is placed in a Storage room.
The cost given is for a basic chest.  Special chests (fancier descriptions,
locks, etc) will cost more.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span>Other flags that are allowed are arena and bank.  Only one bank is
allowed per stronghold at a cost of <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">100k</span> in addition to the cost of
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">200k</span> for the room.  Having an arena will cost <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">100k</span> for the flag in
addition to the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">200k</span> cost of the room.  Up to 9 rooms can be arena rooms.

If there is something you would like for your clan house that is not
listed here, please ask about it and it can be submitted to the Union for
consideration.  However, dwarves being the practical creatures they are,
try to keep it within the boundaries of realism.

Questions about clans and strongholds should be directed to Olah via request
or mudmail.
During Olah's leave of absence, Talis can be contacted as well.
