<span style="font-weight:bold;"> (This is a preliminary version of the restrictions and costing of player-run
shops and is still subject to change.) </span>

In addition to clan strongholds, which are only available to clans, players
can open their own shops.  This helpfile describes both the restrictions
around placement and operation of these shops as well as cost information.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Restrictions</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> Shops must be placed within the walls of or near an existing town.  To
facilitate trade, central locations are preferred; a request to place a shop
in an obscure location (i.e.  crabman village) will probably be refused unless
you can justify a good RP reason.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> You must have a positive, or at worst, neutral reputation with the nation of
the town you plan to operate in or near.  If your reputation with the nation
becomes negative, it will be closed and your funds will not be returned.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> You must be willing to keep your shop open for at least 8 hours a week.  You
don't have to run the shop yourself, but you or another player need to be
present for at least that amount of time.  Player-run shops may not use NPC
shopkeepers of any kind.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Costs</span>
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> The cost of opening a shop is 1000 platinum.  If you can't afford this and
still want to open a shop, send me a mail and I'll see what we can work out.
This includes only 1 room, which may not be a storeroom, a locking mechanism
of the buyer's choice, and up to 30 items that function as keys in whatever
manner the player desires.  Additional rooms for other merchandise use the
same costs outlined in help strongholds, with the exceptions of banks or
arenas, which are not allowed in shops.  Opening in a more exotic location
(hidden shop, or in a cabin several rooms away from a town) will cost an
additional 500pp.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> Costs for furniture, tables, cases to display merchandise, etc.  are the
same as for strongholds.  See help strongholds for more information on these
costs.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">*</span> In addition to the opening and construction costs, you will also be subject
to paying taxes to the city in which you choose to operate.  These taxes vary
by town to town; expect to pay more where there are fewer guards to ensure the
'safety' of your establishment.  You are responsible for reporting and paying
your own taxes on a monthly basis (request an immortal to do this) based on
the tax rate that we quote you when you open your shop.  You can try to fudge
or not pay these fees if you like, but your shop may be subject to audit or
your possessions to confiscation if you decide to go this route.  You should
expect this tax rate to be anywhere from 10 to 50% of the profit generated by
your shop.
