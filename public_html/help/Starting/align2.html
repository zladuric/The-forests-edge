The following is a listing of the nine alignments.  Definitions and
examples are contained therein.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Lawful Good</span> - Characters of this alignment believe that when people
respect society's laws and try to help one another, society as a whole
prospers.  Player's of this alignment believe that by following the Law, 
they will do the most Good, and will follow rules and laws even if 
they may personally feel that a particular law or rule is wrong. 
(An extreme example of this conflict might be a samurai, who follows 
his Lord's command, EVEN if he thinks its wrong, then commits 
seppuku afterwards to display his personal protest.) Lawful good 
players would most likely gravitate to clans of like mind, believing 
them to be first and best (perhaps only) way to do the most good.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Lawful Neutral</span> - As long as there are laws and rules, this character 
will follow them with no hesitation.  The people that the Law has put 
in charge of the character know better than the character what is right 
or wrong. The player 'knows' this, because the Law put those people in 
charge, and the Law is always right. Therefore, such a player will 
follow all orders without question, and believe themselves to be doing 
the right thing, because following the rules will eventually make 
everything work out.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Lawful Evil</span> - This character believes in using laws and rules for his
own gain.  Even if the character is on the bottom rung of the ladder,
they will follow the rules, and learn to use the rules to benefit
themselves and 'get ahead'.  A lawful evil being would be an iron-fisted
tyrant (like Hitler), part of the tyrants regime (a Nazi) or a devious
individual who uses the rules to get what they want (perhaps a lawyer
working for the mob, or someone willfully using laws to protect their own
unethical behavior.) Lawful evil character's would join a clan whose
rigid structure could be used to benefit themselves, or whose iron
control of resources would make him or her powerful by association.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Neutral Good</span> - This character sees the need for good.  He or she uses
laws and rules when they will do good, and ignores them when they seem to
be causing harm.  They do what they think is right at the time.  A lord
who violates orders from his king to destroy something he sees as evil
would be considered neutral good.  A player of this alignment might join
a good clan if it seems that clan might allow them to accomplish the most
good (or might _not_ join a clan for the same reason), but unlike a
lawful good character, the NG character might still go against certain
decisions of the clan (covertly or overtly), if they thought the decision
or rule was wrong.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">True Neutral</span> - True neutral characters dont much care for good or
evil, prefering to stay on the sidelines.  As long as the law doesnt
intrude upon their goals, they abide by it -- when it doesn't, they
ignore it.  A mercenary who fights only for the coin, caring nothing for
either side, would be truly neutral.  They might join a clan if they
stood a good chance of gain without becoming entangled in 'causes'.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Neutral Evil</span> - The only interest of this character is getting ahead.
Whether its by means that are legal or questionable, they take advantage
of it.  They don't have the every-man-for-himself quality of a chaotic
evil, but they have been known to betray friends to the authorities for
personal gain.  They might join a clan if that would benefit them the
most, but would leave if the benefits they perceived faded or did not
develop as planned.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Chaotic Good</span> - Strongly independent, these individuals have no use
for any law or rule.  Their own moral code guides their actions and doing
good is a personal thing.  Any means justifies the end result if that
result is goodness.  A vigilante is an example of chaotic good.  Chaotic
good characters usually think that rules and laws hurt more than they
help...  they may agree with everything the laws stand for, but they
think setting down laws is the first step toward ruining the cause.  Laws
are part of the problem, not the solution, and as such, this character
would rarely join an order or organization, though they might if the the
clan represented a very loose alliance or shared philosophy.  A group of
characters who acted independantly of each other most of the time and
follow their own individual sets of morals, but who do work towards a
common goal and share information and support when possible, without a
strict set of rules might be a good example of a clan a chaotic good
player would join, as would a clan dedicated simply to 'acquiring and
protecting knowledge'.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Chaotic Neutral</span> - These people tend to follow whatever whim strikes
them at the moment.  There is no order or reason to their actions, as
laws and rules mean nothing to them -- many change their mind on a whim.
Good and evil do not affect their decisions.  If they cant decide on 
a course of action, they might flip a coin -- heads, give the child a 
toy; tails, burn the child's house down for sport. Chaotic neutrals 
almost never join a clan, as they don't commit to any cause for more 
than a few days before becoming bored.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Chaotic Evil</span> - Chaotic evil characters see nothing wrong with taking
whatever they want how ever they can.  Laws and rules are for the weak. 
The strong have the right to take what they want.  Bloodthirsty bandits
or a rampaging monster would be chaotic evil. Chaotic evils might form
temporary groups (perhaps to destroy and loot a small town), but would 
never join a long term clan.
