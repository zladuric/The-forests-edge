TOPIC: This helpfile is intended to help those new to The Forest's Edge
get their feet wet.  Just read Phule's Phive Laws of MUDding before you
start your adventures, and don't forget: have fun!
  
   Law 1: Self-Preservation.  Set your <span style="color:blue;">wimpy</span>.  What &quot;wimpy&quot; does is engage a
sense of self-preservation in your character.  Typing &quot;wimpy flee 20&quot; will get
your character to try to start running away whenever he (or she, of course) is
beaten down to 20 percent of their hit points.  Setting your wimpy has Phule's
personal guarantee to save your life at least once, but remember, don't simply
rely on wimpy to get you out of a tight spot.  <span style="color:blue;">Flee</span>ing (typing &quot;flee&quot;) will
also get you to protect your tender hide.
  
   Law 2: Con before kill, look before you leap.  Before you even *think*
about attacking a mob, always try to guage your chances against it.  To
do this type &quot;con monster_name&quot; -- perhaps &quot;con goat&quot; -- and hit enter. 
This will make your character &quot;consider&quot; his/her chance of success
against that monster in a fight.  To start a fight with a monster you
come accross, type &quot;kill monster_name.&quot; Also, before you wander into
unknown territory, type &quot;scan.&quot; This will get your character to look
around the general area and see if there are any monsters lurking about. 
If scan shows that there is an evil newbie-eater to the east, don't go
east.
  
   Law 3: Sustenance.  You may have received a message that you were
feeling hungry or thirsty.  Here at TFE you must eat and drink to be
merry.  Water is readily available from city fountains, and many rivers
and brooks also carry cool, refreshing water for your parched lips.  Food
can be a recently fallen apple, or a loaf of bread you can pick up from a
table.  Just type &quot;eat bread&quot; or &quot;drink fountain&quot; to eat and drink.
  
   Law 4: Clean up your messes.  After you've successfully killed a
monster, you may get more use out if than the simple experience points
you received.  Many corpses, such as those left by rabbits or foxes, can
be skinned to produce valuable pelts or meat.  Just type &quot;skin corpse&quot;
after the fight has ended.
  
   Law 5: Practice before you preach.  To achieve the best success here
at TFE, you need to <span style="color:blue;">practice</span> and hone your skills.  For instance,
you'll have to learn to use that shiny new sword before it will do you
much good.  Many shopkeepers and special NPC's (non-player characters)
have been around and might teach you a thing or two.  Just type &quot;prac&quot; in
a room where you think one of these trainers is.  If you can be taught
there, a list of skills will appear.  Type &quot;prac skill_name&quot; to train
inthat skill.  Type &quot;abil&quot; to see a list of your abilites which can be
learned.
  
  
I hope this helpfile will be of assistance to those of you who need it. 
Remember, if all else fails and you find yourself killed until dead,
Death might give you a second chance to gain revenge on the
slavering-fanged monster which sent you packing to the netherworld. 
Chances are your corpse will sill be laying around with your equipment in
it.  Happy MUDding!!
