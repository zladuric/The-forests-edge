<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Good:</span>
  Creatures of a good alignment work to maximize the good of society
as a whole, benevolently putting the interests of others above, or equal
to, their own.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Neutral:</span>
  Those of a neutral alignment are not overly concerned with the
interests of others, preferring to work toward their own goals.  However,
harming others in the process is not acceptable to them.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Evil:</span>
  Concerned solely with themselves, evil beings will do whatever is
necessary to acheive their goals, regardless of the harm done to those who
get in their way.


  The following categories are personal beliefs.  They reflect how you
live your life within your alignment and society.  There is no right or
wrong, only the way your character feels is the best way to acheive the
goals they desire.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Lawful:</span>
  Lawful characters follow the laws of their society and try to uphold
them.  Order and organization are his two favorite things.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Neutral:</span>
  A neutral person will abide by the laws of his society but he makes
no effort to uphold or encourage them.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Chaotic:</span>
  Chaotic people care nothing for the laws and happily flaunt them
every chance they get.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Note:</span>  A lawful evil character is one who cheerfully backstabs his
fellows if this seems an advantageous action but who believes the best
method of gaining personal happiness is through being in an organization
with his fellows.  He respects the increase in plunder and pillage from
being with other plunderers and pillagers.
