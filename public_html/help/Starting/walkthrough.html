Welcome to the walk through for people playing a mud for the very first
time.  For the purposes of this walk through we're going to assume you
are using a human warrior of non-evil alignment.  If not go ahead and
create a one to practice with until you get the hang of this.  Here's

 Quit this character.
 Wait 5 minutes (policies require this) and reconnect.
 When you reconnect select option 2, start new character.
  (for this you will need your account name and account password)
 Follow the prompting and create a new character, one that is:
  a Human Warrior   of Neutral Good alignment.
 Come back to this help file and read the next section.
    
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">- - - - - - - - - -</span>
   
First, type sleep and hit enter.  For now, all the things you need to do
and learn can be done asleep and it will prevent some of the excess
chatter while you learn.
   
If you start getting messages stating you are hungry or thirsty, type
wake and hit enter, type pray and hit enter, type sleep and hit enter. 
Then resume with this lesson.  Typically you will need to eat food and
drink water, but pray will work in a bind.  Don't use it to often later,
as it takes time to build up and you may need it later.  For now though,
it should suffice as we don't know how long it will take you to get
through the learning process.  :) 
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">- - - - - - - - - -</span>
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">What you're looking at</span>
   
The sreen should be showing you the room's name, a description of it,
possibly the exits, and at the bottom of the screen you will have some
numbers and letters in &lt;&gt; brackets.  The title and room description
should be fairly easy to figure out.  The <span style="color:cyan;">prompt</span> at the bottom (in &lt;&gt;
brackets) are statistics about you and the room that will be quite useful
to you quite often.
  <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">hp</span> means Hit Points.  Its a measure of how much life you have.
     (at 0 you are unconscious and dieing.  at -10 you are dead)
  <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">e</span>  means Energy.  Spell casters use this to cast spells.
     (as a warrior ignore this for now.)
  <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">mv</span> means Movement.  Its a measure of vigor and vim.
     (when its at 0 you can not leave the room or move and must rest)
    
You should also have a list of letters after it.  These are the room
exists visible to you at this time.  <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">N</span>orth <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">E</span>ast <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">S</span>outh
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">W</span>est <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">U</span>p or <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">D</span>own.  There are sometimes other exits, but you
must read the room description and find the hidden commands to open them. 
Example: perhaps a boulder blocks an exit to the east.  Typing move
boulder might move it far enough to reveal an exit if you are strong
enough.
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">- - - - - - - - - -</span>
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">Enhancing your character</span>
  
Starting out you'll have a few skills.  Some weapon proficiencies, some
non-weapon skills, and the ability to understand primal language (what
imms use so everyone can understand them) and to speak and understand
humanic (the human language).  You can see what skills you have already
and what you can currently learn by using the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">Ability</span> command. 
Typing <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">abil weapon</span> will show you what weapon skills you can learn at
this level, which ones you already know (to what proficiency level, max
of 10) and how much it costs per increase in level.
Typing <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">abil</span> alone will show you what other ability types you can
check for.  In this case: <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">abil weapon</span>, <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">abil language</span>, and <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">abil
physical</span>.  We can skip spells for now as warriors do not have access to
spells.  Only spell casters like clerics and mages or specialized
warriors like paladins and rangers can learn spells.
    
As a starting warrior you know a little bit about using daggers.  You
could wield a sword right now, but it wouldn't be very effective.  We can
see, by checking abil weapon, that to learn to use a sword (typically
much more efficient for killing things than a dagger) you would need to
learn the prerequisite of dagger to level 5.  We can do this in one of
two ways.
First, you can use <span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">practice points</span> to have someone train you to use a
dagger better.  Once your dagger skill reaches level 5, you can then
begin learning sword skill.
Second, you can learn through experience.  By wielding a dagger in
combat, there is a random chance you will either improve in dagger skill
or learn something from it and gain a practice point for future use.  For
some skills (primarily spells) the check is made whenever the skill or
spell is used.  For things in almost constant use, like weapon skills or
searching or hiding, the check is made periodically.  If you used the
skill since last check, then a check is made to see if you randomly
improve or not.  What determines success?  Intelligence and Wisdom both
contribute in some ways to how easily you improve.  Having a low
intelligence or wisdom will decrease your abilities in the long run. 
Having a high intelligence and wisdom will earn you more practices and
improvements over time, but it will come at the cost of other skills like
strength, endurance and dexterity.  the skill primarily used for fighting.
