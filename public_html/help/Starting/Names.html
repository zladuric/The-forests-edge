Its important to realize that we take names somewhat seriously here.  Your
character's name will be seen by others and is directly a part of the
atmosphere of the game.  If an Avatar (AV) or Immortal (Imm) ask you to change
your name to match policy, then you do have to change it even if you were
recently approved.

* First, the best names are medieval sounding or otherwise similar to a
  fantasy setting.
* Second, names must be names.  (Slasher, Mauler, Bashur, these aren't names)
* Nicknames are unlikely to be accepted.  (ie Slim, Baldy, Skippy)
* Please use common sense when creating names.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">The basic guidelines for unacceptable names are:</span>

* Main characters largely identified with a specific well-known book, movie,
  cartoon, comic, anime or other media. (Bilbo, Akira, Mojo Jojo)
* Titles may not be included in names (Sir Peabody, Queen Ann)
* Names that are vulgar or offensive (you get the idea)
* Names or attributes of deities, angels, demons, or any other major figures
  in world religions (Jesus, Satan, Beelzebub, Buddha)
* Bastardizations of any of the above (Billbo, Sirknight, Mi-lafs)

Now, having read all that, its possible you may have noticed a few people with
names that may somewhat violate this list.  Some of those people are likely
pending a name change themselves.  Some others, however, are players who have
been playing for some time and these long-term players may well have been
grandfathered in and allowed to keep their name in deference to the time
they've played here.  Just because they were fortunate enough does not mean we
will ignore the rules entirely and it does not mean you can automatically keep
your name if it violates the policy.  In the event that a newly-trained AV
passes a name that shouldn't have been, as has happened once in a while,
another AV or an immortal may come along and have you change your name to meet
the naming policy.  Please don't argue, everyone makes mistakes and its our
job to fix them.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">Medieval Names:</span>
We've asked both that people use medieval/fantasy names and that they don't
use names of primary characters from books.  Please bear in mind that most
people didn't live in medieval times so they aren't going to know obscure
medieval names.  Since most commonly known medieval names have either been
used as a main character in a book or are still in use today there is an
extreme problem with people finding &quot;acceptable&quot; names.  Use some common sense
when denying names.  The idea was to avoid Bilbos and Gandalfs but something
like Osric is fine, even though its used as a primary or secondary character
in multiple books.  By that token, something like Gandalf (an actual medieval
name) probably would be acceptable but we've denied it on the basis that
Tolkien's works are so prevalent and the fantasy name has taken precedence as
too common.

If someone wanted to use the name Fosco as a halfling I certainly wouldn't be
offended or find problem even though a little research shows that's one of
the hobbit names Tolkien used.  If anything, I'd quietly praise them for doing
a bit of research, picking a fantasy appropriate name, actually applying it to
the &quot;accepted&quot; race for it, and not having to resort to picking primary
character names.  If all else fails, even a common modern name (since many
have basis in older medieval names) should suffice.  Remember, we're here to
help guide people into the setting not dominate their wills and tell them how
to play.  Provided they aren't overtly ruining the game for others let them
play, we're all here to have fun.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">Offensive Names:</span>
If the name is offensive, Avatars and Immortals may either ask the player to
change the name, or they may disconnect the player entirely.  This decision
should be based on the degree of offensiveness and how reasonable the player
is.  Some people *do* log on for the sole purpose of causing trouble; these
people should be dealt with accordingly.

As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars alike should
politely ask for a name change.  If the player refuses, please talk to or mail
an immortal about the situation and encourage the player to do the same.  <span style="color:cyan;">DO
NOT APPROVE</span> a player whose name is inappropriate.
