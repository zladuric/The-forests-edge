When you are overcome in battle and you die, your soul is taken to the paths
of death.  Death, in his infinite wisdom, will grant you another chance to
achieve your life's goals at the small price of 1/4 of your life's
experience.  However, when you are returned to the realms, you are weak, and
disoriented.  This does pass after a short time, and you will soon be at your
maximum capacity once more.

A part of the reason you are weakened when you die is because your spirit had
to use some of its essence to recreate a body to inhabit.  You're former body,
now divested of life, is no longer suitable and can not be used for the
purpose of sustaining your spirit.  The remains you leave behind will often
contain a few pieces of your gear that did not return with you when you
returned from Death.  Those remains will eventually decay.  The time it takes
to decay varies a little with each death but is generally a little under an
hours time.

If you are not able to recover your own corpse and the items left on it,
anyone whom you have befriended may recover them for you.

If the MUD is intentionally rebooted by an immortal, gear that remains on your
corpses (only those on the ground) will be transported to your bank vault.
