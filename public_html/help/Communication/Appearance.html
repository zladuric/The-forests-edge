<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">SYNTAX:</span>

appearance &lt;text&gt;  : sets your appearance

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">DESCRIPTION:</span>

   Characters that you have never met before are described by their
physical appearance.  Only after a player <span style="text-decoration:underline;">introduces</span> themselves to
you will you see their name.  This appearance can be set by the player. 
The commands to do so are appearance and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">keywords</span>.

   <span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Appearances do not need to start with &quot;a/an.&quot;  The game does this
for you.  You do not need a &quot;.&quot; at the end.</span>

   Your appearance should show those physical characteristics that
another person would first notice when looking at you.  It should not
show emotion or how someone might react to your appearance.  Avoid words
that would be assumed for your race already (i.e.  short, stocky dwarf or
tall, thin vyan).  Appearances should also not include actions such as
hiding (a thief skill) or things that assume how you are clothed.  <span style="font-weight:bold;">DO
NOT PUT YOUR CLASS IN YOUR APPEARANCE!</span> Your race *should* be included (
disguses do not, as such, exist right now, so appearances such as
'mysterious figure cloaked in darkest samite' are not acceptable.)
References to your race should not be capitalized.  And if you wish to
use a number in your appearance, please spell it out.

Your keywords should include every word from your appearance, including
race, separated by spaces, not commas.

Slang such as &quot;buff, ripped, butch, cool, etc&quot; is not acceptable and will
not be approved.

Lastly.  you need to set a description.  This is done with the command
<span style="text-decoration:underline;">description</span>.  After you have set appearance, keywords and description ask
politely over the request channels for any avatar to approve you (&quot;help
request&quot;).  It is mandatory that you be approved to gain any level past 5th.
There are a great many players these days, and it is a good idea to try
to come up with keywords, and a part of your appearance that are unique.

An example of an unacceptable appearance or two:
   Jedi Knight
   mysterious figure
   two-headed Chaos Troll, crackling with eldrich energy
   tall, dark, thin vyan
   tall elf radiating a bright aura of goodness
   short, stock dwarf with a beard
   short green guy
   15 foot tall Ogre picking his teeth

Some examples of acceptable appearances:
   red-bearded dwarf with an axe-shaped tattoo
   silver-eyed, graceful elven maiden
   warty, slack-jawed troll covered in tribal scars
   bandy-legged goblin with crooked teeth
   balding orc with bright-red tufts of hair
   lice-infested, one-eyed ogre
