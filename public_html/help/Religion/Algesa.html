Algesa, the Goddess of Law, is most often seen in the form of a tall, strong
warrior.  She wears shining armor of exquisite quality, though also completely
functional.  Her blade, Divine Justice, is always by her side.  It is a
hand-and-a-half sword, with a golden hilt and a razor sharp but unadorned
blade.

She is the soul of law, favoring neither good, nor evil, but simply seen by
her followers to be absolute law -- swift, sure, and unchallenged.  She is
sworn foe to Ulthi, god of Chaos, and all his followers.  Algesa opposes all
illegal acts, and urges her followers to do the same.  At times, when due
process seems to have fallen by the wayside, Algesa and her followers have
been known to take the law into their own hands, as for they believe, the law
springs from their hands.  Algesa has been known to be an ally with Kerog, as
she believes firmly in the right of war and conquest to uphold and defend
law.  She looks with disfavor, though, on rebellions.

Her symbol is a set of scales balanced on the hilt of a sword, usually a
depiction of the blade Divine Justice.

Algesa is worshipped extensively in Medienne, where the refuge of law is
sought in the aftermath of war.  Surprisingly, Algesa is also followed in
Voaleth, where the word of the Tyrant is breathed to be law itself.  Algesa
only accepts those followers with a commitment to law, and as such does not
approve of roguish elements attempting to infiltrate her faithful.

Allowed worshipper alignments: any lawful (LG, LN, LE)
