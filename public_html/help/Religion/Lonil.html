Lonil, the Radiant One, is the god of good and light.  He appears to his
chosen most often as a brave young swordsman, the gold of the sun in his hair
and an ebullience filling his sky blue eyes.  He wears a shining suit of
platemail, the mithril always reflecting and amplifying the ambient light
about him.  This light is often just a soft white glow about him, but can be
intensified to damage his enemies at his whim.  It is said to be death to for
evil to look upon Lonil in wrath.  He bears a shield, enameled in white and
emblazoned with his symbol, the sun.

Lonil's followers are known throughout the realm as pure-hearted warriors, as
the light of the Radiant One purges all taints of evil from the souls of those
who seek to walk in his footsteps.  His disciples seek always to protect the
weak and abused, the poor and the innocent, their virtuous lifestyle earning
them a well deserved reputation of chivalry.  Always the followers of Lonil
strive to bathe even the darkest corners of the world in the glory of the
light, ridding the land of evil's shadow whenever possible.

Lonil is the epitome of good, which may override and supersede the law in the
eyes of his followers, especially when the law is foul and unnecessarily
cruel.  This puts him sometimes at odds with Algesa, but they are often united
against Ulthi, god of Chaos.  The Dark Gods view the Radiant One as their
tireless foe, one to be triumphed over in their quest for darkness.  The Ebon
Triumvirate has a peculiar relationship with Lonil, as Morkith and Xiroce both
hate everything he represents, the Light side of Morr gets along quite well
with Lonil, and many of that faith claim friendship with the followers of
Lonil.  The Dark followers of Morr, however, throw their lot in with the other
of the Three.  Temohpab, in particular, battles against Lonil, and reserves a
special honor (it is rumored) for a follower who has slain a Radiance.  The
Radiant One has countered that with increasing vigilance of the followers of
Light.  Followers of the Radiant One must be of good alignment, though all
light races may choose to follow him, humans are his most prevalent disciples.

Lonil accepts only those given to light as worshippers, and he especially
frowns upon thieves and other practitioners of evil arts.

Allowed worshipper alignments:  any good (LG, NG, CG)
