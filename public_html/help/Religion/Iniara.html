Iniara, the Dark Mistress, is goddess of hate, pain, lust, and revenge.  She
appears most often as a stunningly beautiful vyan woman, unapproachable and
remote in her perfection.  Her eyes are often red-hued, as is her hair.  She
favors the color of blood for garments, and often sports crimson lacquer on her
long fingernails.

Iniara is called the Dark Mistress from her past relationship with Temohpab,
and it is no secret she desires him to make her queen.  It has never happened,
much to her bitterness and that of her followers, primarily the vyan race. 
She is the Mistress of pain, of hate, of all of the dark emotions that burn in
the dark places of the soul.  Some attribute all ambition to her dark
attentions, as well as all covetuousness and pride.  Iniara particularly
detests the other goddesses of the realm, believing them to be her
competition.  Dawnstar is her sworn foe, though she denies speculation that
Temohpab would enjoy more despoiling a pure goddess than one already of
darkness.

Her symbol is a sinuously curved dagger, set with rubies.

The Dark Mistress will accept followers as long as they are not good, though
she prefers those with dark hearts and souls.

Allowed worshipper alignments:  any non-good (LN, PN, CN, LE, NE, CE)
