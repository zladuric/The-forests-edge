Deep within the multi-colored canopy, hidden amongst the fauna of the
forest lives the goddess known to all who follow the ways of the
woodlands: Cynnis, guardian of nature.  She is known to her followers as
the Lady of the Forest, or simply Mother Nature.  She loves and looks
after all the plants and animals of the world, but Cynnis always has a
special place in her heart for the verdant green forests.  For this
reason, she has attracted a large number of ent and elven followers;
indeed, many woodsmen and hunters are devoted to her because of her
intrests in the woodlands and the animals that make them their home.

Not a forest in the land has escaped the gentle hand of Cynnis and her
followers.  Cynnis believes natural beauty to be the highest form of
perfection, and considers any unnecessary alterations of this tangible
perfection a perversion.  She does, however, grudgingly allow the peoples
of the earth to take what they need of Nature's abundant resources,
though those who seek to wantonly destroy her lands often live to regret
it.  Cynnis recognizes the needs of both predators and prey, as death is
merely a part of life's natural cycle.  The willful destruction of her
creatures, be they the flora or fauna, however, is not tolerated.  In
respect for the land, followers of Cynnis do not wear steel.

Those who claim to have seen the Lady of the Forests in her domain claim
that she appears as a large, snow-white wolf, a very tall and graceful ent, or as a beautiful
elven archer, her hair a mane of honey-gold locks, carrying a longbow of
silvery white birch that seems almost alive.  Even without actually
seeing her, though, there is not a woodsman who has not felt her serene
prescence while amidst the wooded groves.  Her symbol is that of the wolf
whose form she sometimes shares: large, with a shimmering coat of purest
white and brillant green eyes representing the natural world she holds so
dear.
