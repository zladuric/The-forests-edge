Taranth, Lady of Peace, is the Goddess of Peace and Healing.
Favoring the appearance of a young human maiden, blonde of hair and blue of
eyes, she looks very much like the daughter of Lonil.  She wears simple white
robes, tied with a belt of ivy.  The Lady of Peace is light of step, and every
sighting of her has reported her barefoot.

Taranth is the most pure-hearted of all of the gods, and is devoted only to
life.  Through healing, peace, and charity, she seeks the lives of all
creatures.  While sometimes called the Daughter of Lonil, it is unclear
whether or not she actually is.  Writings do often tell of her calling him
&quot;Father&quot; and the close bond they share, but this may be more to Taranth's
innocent and childlike outlook than blood relation.

In an alliance older than mortal writings and recollection, Kerog has declared
Taranth under his protection.  The Red Wind has even done battle against other
gods for protection of Taranth, allowing none to harm her.  The details and
origins of the agreement of the treaty between Kerog and Taranth are unclear,
but the results are thus: Kerog's followers are sworn to raise no hand to any
of Taranth's followers, and the healers of Taranth have sworn to heal both
sides of any war, regardless of motive or cause.  Such is the respect for life
that all who follow Taranth have, that they will heal even the most foul of
evil, as the believe that there is still goodness left within.  All life is
sacred, and all may return to the light.

Morkith considers himself foe to Taranth, but the Lady of Peace holds nothing
against him, and still grants the arts of healing to his practitioners.

Taranth's symbol is a dove wreathed in leaves of ivy.

Taranth accepts only those who hold life as primary in their heart as
followers.  She cannot understand what drives people to devote their lives
solely to war, so she does not accept warriors.  Thieves, for use of some of
their skills, are also not something she can condone within her flock, though
they will not be denied any healing.

Allowed worshipper alignment: any non-evil (LG, NG, LN, PN)
