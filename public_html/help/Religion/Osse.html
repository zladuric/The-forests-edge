Osse, Rainlord and Master of Water, is god of Water, spring, and the oceans of
the realm.  Legend tells of him appearing as a large figure of water striding
on land, without losing form or cohesion.  More often, he offers signs of his
presence as an unexpected, localized rainfall.  Also, plants, particularly
flowering ones, that spring forth from barren ground are said to be a sign of
Osse, in his aspect of Spring.

As all the elemental deities, Osse remains neutral in the strife between
gods.  He does not seem to care much for any affairs of mortals, save for
those who dwell within or near the water.  Fishermen are said to be under his
protection, save they honor the sea and do not overharvest.  His rather
taciturn nature is given over to a more joyous one, though still somewhat
somber, in the season of spring.  The Master of Water wakes the earth and
again stirs life up from its dormant winter sleep.  The many rains during
spring are said to be Osse's sign of affection for this time of year.

The Rainlord's symbol is a stylized drop of water, point up.  Alternatively,
those Ossean followers who follow the ocean aspect honor the symbol of a
stylized cresting wave.

Osse accepts worshippers of any alignment, provided they understand the
importance of Water.

Allowed worshipper alignments: any
