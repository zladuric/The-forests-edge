This is an out-dated and no longer applies file kept for a few reasons:
posterity, reference, and to show people just what happens when we have to
deal with people arguing points like 'The help names file doesn't specifically
say I can't name myself bottlecap so I think I should be able to'.
See <span style="color:blue;">help names</span> for current information.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">- - - - -</span>

Names should be medieval sounding or otherwise similar to a fantasy setting. 
Names are meant to be just that, names.  Nicknames are well and nice, but they
can easily be added to your keywords.  Names should be things like Handaran,
Aelrynne, Kuhrt or even Joan (depending upon your character race). 
Adjectives, adverbs, and generally descriptive words are poor substitutes for
a name.  Also, it is best to avoid names based on verbs like Slasher, Mauler
or Killer.  Such names will only invite a name change.

Changing a single letter to make a minor difference is essentially the same as
using the donor name.  Klown will be treated in the same manner as Clown --
that is, it will be subject to a change.

Names obviously generated by reversing words or other names are unacceptable. 
Examples include Mrots, Teloiv, and Susej.  Interpretation of the &quot;obviously&quot;
qualifier is left to the discretion of the Avatars and Immortals.  Slightly
modifying the reversed word is also not acceptable.  The rule is that an
unacceptable name is also unacceptable if it is reversed.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">Most importantly:</span> If an Avatar asks you to change your name, it is assumed
they have a good reason and you should comply.  You may MUDmail Zithuan (read
&quot;help mail&quot;) with questions or complaints.  All complaints will be
investigated and appropriate action taken.  However, please remember that
Avatars will be given the power to change your name immediately if it is
obscene or in direct violation of our naming policy in the game.  Just because
your name is allowed by one Avatar at the time of your approval doesn't mean
another Avatar won't recognize it from a book or movie, so be aware that you
may still be asked to think of an alternative name if the situation warrants. 
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">There is no grandfather clause applicable if you are level 10 or below.</span>
Players levels 11 or above who are in violation of the naming policies of the
game will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.


<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">The basic guidelines for unacceptable names are:</span>

* Words from the dictionary or word-blends that don't make sense.  Who is
going to name their son Sheepkiller?  Answer: Nobody.  It's a nickname, not a
real name.
* Main characters from reasonably well-known books, movies, cartoons, comics,
anime or other media forms.  Examples of this are Bilbo, Akira or Mojo Jojo.
* Names of cities, countries, or worlds, both real or fictional.  Hershey
would be unacceptable, and so would Dune or Nashkel.
* Famous names or names strongly associated with a particular topic (Osama Bin
Laden, Curie, Oksana).
* Names including titles (Sir Peabody, Queen Ann).
* Major foreign words.  Major is defined as anything known to whoever is
around, but may well include things like Joie (&quot;joy&quot;) or Cabeza (&quot;head&quot;).
* Nicknames (names that depend upon the person you are now, or some physical
attribute (Lightfingers, Stubbytoes, One-eye).
* Bastardizations of any of the above (Frendz, Doonbuggy, Mi-lafs).
* Names of inanimate objects, particularly those that frequent the MUD (Tree,
Stone, Stream, Road).
* Names of real or mythical animals (Griffon, Lion, Bird, Eagle, Woodworm,
Bear).
* Names of famous people, real or fictional (Princess Leia, Cindy Crawford,
John Doe)
* Names that are vulgar or offensive (you get the idea).
* Names or attributes of deities, angels, demons, or any other major figures
in world religons (Jesus, Satan, Beelzebub, Buddha).
* Names of anachronistic or modern items, or items not found in a medieval
setting (Toothpaste, Shoepolish, Moonunit).
* Anything that requires an article (The Tick, Thetick, The Pope, A Killer, Da
Boss).
* Names based on actions (Slasher, Mauler, Killer, Basher)
* Names based on your occupation or race (Ranger Bob, Warrior Ted, Ima
Gobbi-Healer)
* Names that are variants of names that won't pass (Joanne Ark, Ghandalf)
* Names that are not names (Bignstupid, Jackofclubs, noname)
* Names based on combinations of above (BearMauler, Rat King, Joie d'Blade)

<span style="color:cyan;">*****</span> AVATAR AND IMMORTAL NOTES <span style="color:cyan;">*****</span>
If the name is offensive, Avatars and Immortals may either ask the player to
change the name, or they may disconnect the player entirely.  This decision
should be based on the degree of offensiveness and how reasonable the player
is.  Some people *do* log on for the sole purpose of causing trouble; these
people should be dealt with accordingly.

As long as the name is not offensive, Immortals and Avatars alike should
politely ask for a name change.  If the player refuses, please talk to or mail
an immortal about the situation and encourage the player to do the same.  <span style="color:cyan;">DO
NOT APPROVE</span> a player whose name is inappropriate.
