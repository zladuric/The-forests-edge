Trolls are big and slow.  Make that <span style="color:blue;">BIG</span>.  Known for their prowess in
battle, their superior physical attributes, and their great size, Trolls
are known to be unsurpassed warriors.  Along with these physical traits
comes a particular dimness of mind and of senses, and Trolls able to cast
spells are rare, and often less than competent.

Trolls' metabolisms are famous as well for their speed;
they regenerate much more quickly than other races, and consequently
must eat a great deal more to satiate their great stomachs.

As a thoroughly subterranean race, Trolls are adversely affected by
therays of the sun.  They rarely venture forth to see the light of day,
only doing so at night, or on those cloudy, dim days when the sun is at
its weakest.  Trolls fear fire, for its affects harm the race to a great
extent, and slows their recuperative capacities.

As citizens of the underground world [Note: now under construction],
Trolls live in loosely-organized clan bands which meet with other bands
(&quot;nations&quot;) at regular intervals, holidays, etc.  Trolls generally get
along well with one another, and frequently associate with Ogres, as the
two races are frequently of like mind.  Trolls perceive Vyans as
untrustorthy schemers, though useful allies in dire circumstances. 
Goblins make useful servants, and Orcs often function as valueable allies
while hunting (and, they hope, skinning) the vile Eleint.

Like surface elves, Dwarves and Gnomes are intolerable and utterly
disgusting to Trolls.  Gnomes are utterly insufferable to Trolls, who
cannot understand their lack of appreciation for the fine art of mindless
destruction and cold, dark places.  Humans are a puzzle to trolls - some
make great allies and comrades in arms, while some are just as bad as the
worst Eleint.  The fact that humans have hunted trolls for body parts in
the past, along with gnomes, does nothing to improve relations.  Trolls
credit Elves with making a fine stew.
 
There are generally two varieties of troll: the southern, or swamp,
troll, and the northern, or ice, troll.
