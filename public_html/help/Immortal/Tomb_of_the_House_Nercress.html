The House Nercress ruled from mountain to sea near the end of the last
age.  Allied with the goodly silver dragons, the House Nercress ruled
with wisdom, goodness, and justice.  A temple housing the dragons was
constructed high upon one of the granite mountains, beside the ancient
tombs of the royal house.

Lord Necress had seen his kingdom grow and prosper, but he feared for the
future.  He had no sons, only the daughter which was the light of his
life.  In her, he saw the glimmering beauty of his wife, who had died
during childbirth.  He feared for her, and for his people, for the war of
succession to come at his death would be bloody indeed, if peace could
not be insured.

But worse still was the fate which befell the House Nercress.  Usurpers,
seeking the throne, kidnapped the Lord's only joy and stole away to their
dark keep.  Leading a flight of gleaming silver, Lord Nercress stormed
their parapets and sought to retrieve his daughter.  He returned only
with her slashed corpse.  He cast himself into his own tomb to die of
grief, but not before swearing the silver dragons to forever watch over
his land and his people, to fight back the tide of evil which was even
then beginning to sweep over the lands.
