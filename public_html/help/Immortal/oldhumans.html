The humans of The Forest's Edge are much like you or me in physical
appearance.  They are used as the benchmark for other races to measure
themselves against, and are known for being solid all-around in their
abilities and professional opportunities.

In the past, Humans have had extensive contact with Gnomes, and have
experienced generally strong relations with them, as much as any
generalization about two groups of such size.  Humans and Dwarves have
fairly strong ties on the whole, while relations between Humans and Elves
have been fairly volatile, as both sides have had trouble understanding
each others' intentions, leading to a series of misfortunes over the past
centuries.

Humans and Orcs do not get along well at all.  Ogres and Trolls are seen
in a similar light, though in the past Ogres have hired themselves out to
humans as mercenaries.  Goblins are viewed as capricious little
troublemakers who are best met with force so they leave humankind alone
and go bother the Dwarves.  Vyans have had very little contact with
humans, and even as Human-Eleint relations are touch-and-go, bordering on
the negative.  To Humans, the Eleint are a strange lot whos kidnappings
and ambushes of humans in the past, together with sometime cooperative
efforts, makes them seem, at best, a schizophrenic race.  Vyans, for
their part, are viewed with extreme suspicion, and in the past those
Vyans unfortunate to be caught by humans have sometimes been burned at
the stake as demons.  As a result, most Human-Vyan meetings tend to be
short andbloody.
