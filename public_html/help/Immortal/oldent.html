Ents are large, sturdy, bipedal beings often mistaken at first glance as
being part of the landscape.  However, this <span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">does not</span> mean that they
ARE trees.  Their heads are very tall, and they have hardly any necks at
all.  Their arms are covered with smooth brown skins, and their large
feet have seven toes each.  They generally have long beards which are
bushy and twiggy.  Their tree-like nature makes them slow and ponderous,
though they are not at all sedentary.  Ents are strong and have excellent
constitutions, however, they are susceptible to the forces of nature,
most especially fire.
 
This ancient race's native tongue is very difficult for other races to
learn; but they quite easily have learned elvish.  Besides their natural
friendship with the forest-dwelling elves, ents are also very friendly
with gnomes and lizardfolks.  They have less understanding of the
underground dwelling dwarves, but are not openly hostile.  This good race
has troubles with all of the <span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">dark</span> races found in the world.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">With regard to an ent's appearance and description, keep in mind that
ent's are not trees.  An ent's appearance should reflect the fact that
he/she IS an ent.  While it is acceptable to compare ents with or ascribe
certain traits of trees to ents, neither the description nor the
appearance of an ent should state in any fashion that he/she IS a tree.
