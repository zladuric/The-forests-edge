As a general rule, Ogres are big, mean, and dumb.  They make wonderful
warriors but generally feeble wizards and clerics, due to their innate
tendencies towards high strength and constitution and low intelligence
and wisdom.  Their great size is often of use in combat as well, making
them excellent bashers.  Ogre mages and clerics, rare though they may be,
are not unknown to the realms.

Ogres frequently stand up to 7' in height, and weigh a great deal.  Their
skin is rubbery, and their eyes dull.  Ogres are famous for their great
appetites and fast metabolisms, their rates of regeneration being second
only to Trolls.

Ogres do not like little creatures, who tend to cause problems and/or
steal things.  If they cannot be bullied, they should be smashed.  Humans
can be a similar problem, and dwarves tend to show up at the worst times,
and also merit destruction.  Trolls, though strange and frankly, pretty
dumb, make for useful allies, as do the fragile but cunning Vyans.  Orcs
are viewed with a measure of respect, as they know how cut things,
while Elves and Lizardmen are hated as a matter of course.
 
There are generally two varieties of ogre: the grey ogre, and the red
ogre.  Grey ogres tend to be somewhat stronger, yet even more dim in the
brain, while red ogres are somewhat smaller, yet possess a fierce,
sinister intelligence.
