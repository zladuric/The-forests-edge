Here is some background information on my new, handy-dandy, religions.
----
Back in the day, oh, say 5000 years (old enough for elven memory to be come
misty, though not forgotten), there was something called the Godswar.  The
sides in the Godswar are pretty much broken down the lines as they are in help
religions.

The war ended with a large cataclysm that destroyed many things and changed
almost entirely the face of the earth -- the Vaasa and parts sacred to
particular gods were saved, though not all.  The side of Light won.  That is
why many of the dark races are underground or far from what we consider
civilization.

Temohpab, in particular, was bound from the surface of the earth, until
recently.  He had been sheltered in the earth, by Kantos, who as he wishes to
preserve the earth, could not bear to have one of the essential forces of the
earth lost.  In return for that, Temohpab changed his goal from destruction of
the earth to domination, swearing to Kantos an oath that he will leave the
earth standing.  As a neutral god, Kantos accepted, not caring which force
covered the earth, as long as it remained.

(I'd like to do a lost city zone that was swallowed by the cataclysm -- I
think it would be cool.)

The Slen-Lodar thing explained:
Back before the Godswar, Slen and Lodar were a bit of an item -- Lodar was not
yet called the Black Star, and he was only the God of Mischief.  He wanted to
join the side of Light and be with Slen, but Lonil refused to let his twin,
Ashallan join the light side.  Lodar refused to join without Ashallan, and
turned away from the side of Light.  He turned away from Slen, heading instead
with his sister to the Dark Gods, becoming the Black Star and God of Cruelty. 
He has been festering over his not being good enough to be with the gods of
Light (which is not necessarily true) and their denial of his sister (which
was at Algesa's prompting, as she despises theives), for the past thousands of
years from then until now.  Slen still loves him, and wanted to talk to him --
she made several overtures before and during the Godswar, but he refused to
admit her to his presence.  He still loves Slen, but does not want her to see
what he has become.  He was seduced by Iniara not long after his Fall, and has
felt 'tainted' ever since.  This huge mess has become a bitter hatred between
the clergies, and probably will give us neat zones/quests ideas.
