A bit slow and a bit dumb, Orcs are nevertheless know to be tough, wily
and strong foes worthy of one's respect.  Slightly larger than a human,
Orcs prefer the dark confines of underground caverns and the hidden
realms of the underworld to the light of day, and will emerge into
sunlight on only the dimest of days, if they can help it, and only after
expressing their dismay at having to suffer from 'that accursed
brightness.'

Orcs are known to be none too fond of Elves, particularly the Eleint,
whom to Orcs are only valued for their skins and teeth.  Orcs begrudingly
respect Vyans, due to their continual warfare with and mutual hatred
toward the Eleint.  Dwarves and Gnomes make excellent slaves, food, or
both.

Orcs are generally on amiable terms with Ogres as well as Goblins, whom
they frequently like to bully (with varying amounts of success).  Orcs
and Trolls tend not to get along well at all, except when hunting the
accursed Eleint (Trolls being insufferable bullies).

Not the strongest spell-casters, Orcs are known to be excellent warriors
and thieves.  They have, however, been known to succeed in whatever
profession they might choose to pursue.
 
There are two basic varieties of orc: the eastern orc, and the western
orc.  The eastern orcs tend to be more chaotic and tribal, while the
western orcs are somewhat larger and more intelligent.
