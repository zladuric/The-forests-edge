Small, tough and wily, Goblins are known for being good at a lot of
things, with the general exception of magic.  Quick and hardy, goblins
make excellent thieves due to their generally high dexterity and small
stature, though persistent individuals have managed in the past to
succeed at a wide variety of careers, including magical ones.

Goblins <span style="color:blue;"></span><span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">despise</span> daylight, dwarves, elves, and humans, and prefer to
torture and tease any creatures which they may come across.  They also
conceive of trolls and ogres as utterly insufferable, generally because,
like orcs, these races tend to use their superior size and strength to
bully goblins into doing what they don't want to do.  Goblins will not
associate with Dwarves, due to long-standing tensions and a bloody
history between the two races, nor do they particularly like Elves (of
any type).  Dwarves are viewed with outright hatred, due to their
continued butchery of innocent goblins over countless centuries.  &quot;The
only good part of a dwarf is his scalp&quot; states a common Goblin proverb. 
Gnomes, strangely, are a puzzle to Goblins, who figure that somehow the
two races must be related, with Gnomes of course the lesser relation in
need of help from Goblins.  Why Gnomes cannot learn to take orders and
continue to associate with other, evil races is a source of constant
frustration to Goblins, who would desperately like a new ally (or, even
better, someone they could actually bully).

Most often green, brown or some disgusting combination of mottled earth
tone in skin color, Goblins stand about 4' in height.  They hate light,
live far underground and prefer sharp, stabbing weapons and short, thick
bladed axes which are easy to swing in confined spaces.  Spears are also
a favored weapon.
 
There are generally two varieties of goblins: the generally small, and
more common, green goblins, and the white goblins, a rare variety of
northern goblins which have a tendency to being larger and less chaotic
in their organization.
