Lizardmen are strange specimens, being large, bipedal reptiles.  They are
strong and sturdy, but slightly lacking in intelligence and dexterity. 
When fighting bare-handed a lizardman does more damage than most due to
their sharp claws, which are large and powerful but do sometimes make
grasping and manipulation of fine objects or details a bit difficult. 
They are unable to whistle though so have to find other means to call
their pets, and sometimes have to find special gear to protect their
hands.

Lizardmen are a generally reclusive race, getting along best with those
of their own kind.  Despite their misgivings, they tend to get along well
with Gnomes and Humans, though they cannot brook Dwarves' behavior
despite the the faith placed in them by Gnomes.  Lizardmen do not mix
well with the Eleint; some speculate that this stems from a past. 
misunderstanding of temporal importance, while others argue that the
conflict's roots relate to religious matters, and the two races' loyalty
to deities with competing spheres of influence.  In any case, Lizardmen
like the Eleint's evil cousins even less, having fought a number of wars
against the Vyans in the past.  Similarly, continued raids upon Lizardman
settlements by Orcs, Ogres and Trolls have initated a hatred of these
races among Lizardmen; for their part, Goblins are despised due to their
theft and sale of lizardmen eggs to slaves, notably Vyans.
 
Lizardmen, as a whole, live solely in regions of swampland.  Serpentmen,
a distant relative, tend to prefer the more arid, desert climates. 
Lizardmen are _not_ serpentmen.
