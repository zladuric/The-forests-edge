So, you want an alignment change.  Well..... NO!!!

All kidding aside, the truth of the matter is you probably aren't going
to get one.  I'll lay down the basics for you so you'll understand where
matters lie.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Rule #1</span>: NO ONE gets to change alignment between Good - Neutral - Evil.
This may have happened in the past, but it is unequivocally not going to
happen now.  Policy stands.
That means no good to neutral, no neutral to good.  No neutral to evil,
and no evil to neutral, and absolutely no good to evil or vice-versa.
Let me clarify good, neutral and evil.  They are the 3 base alignments.

Good = lawful good, neutral good, chaotic good.
Neutral = lawful neutral, pure neutral, chaotic neutral.
Evil = lawful evil, neutral evil, chaotic evil.

In other words... Neutral Good means you are of &quot;good&quot; alignment, NOT &quot;neutral&quot;.
In any alignment where neutral is the first word, it means neutrality of
law and chaos, not neutrality of good and evil alignment.

Ok, hopefully we have that little bit of confusion straightened out.  The
last part seems to confuse so many people, and a thorough understanding
of it can save both your and our lives a great deal of mental sparring
over a pointless debate.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Rule #2</span>: You can not change from lawful to chaotic or chaotic to lawful.
Pretty straightforward I think.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Rule #3</span>: Even if you manage the nearly impossible feat of earning an
alignment change once, it will NOT happen again.  For example, if you
start as chaotic good, the best you can ever hope for is neutral good. 
In truth, you probably won't even get that.


Its not that we don't think people can change, we even used to do them
occassionally, but the problem is almost all the time it is for reasons
that are not realistic (realistic being used with some artisic license,
as it means real within the little fantasy realm we have created here). 
In the end, it wasn't worth altering 100 people because 1 person in the
group had a good reason and bothered to follow role playing restrictions
anyhow.  Most people who want one haven't bothered role playing their
alignment in the first place.  The only reason they're asking is to join
a clan or use equipment they can't currently.

So, how can you get one of these rare alterations of your personna?
My suggestions are as follows...

First, ask an imm if they'll even consider doing it.
(After all the hassle, and policy stating we wont we still have the same
100 people trying to argue to change because &quot;they're reason should be
allowed, even though they understand why no one else's should.&quot;) 
If they say no, don't argue about it.  This is about the only time asking
another imm might work.  Asking an imm after one has told you no we won't
allow you only gets you in trouble because we post such things.  If they
said no because they are tired of the whining (and most of it is whining)
then they'll probably just say no and hope you leave them alone.  Arguing
will only make them mad and work against you.

Second, be prepared to make a commitment.
I tell them to role play their current alignment for about a month.
post notes showing that they are playing that alignment, at least 1
well-written, well-role-played note on stories a week.
Then, over the next month role play the gradual change of character and
post notes on how that's going too.  At the end, if you've impressed me
suitably that you are, in fact, role playing and have some concept about
what the alignment you are and are changing to entails, I'll probably
change you.

A little side-note about the posted notes.  A well-written note may be
short, but more often than not you aren't going to be able to write out
all you need to place (atmosphere, setting, drama, what have you) in a
single paragraph.  Such a note should be posted on stories board, as this
is the story of your character's current life.

(The only exception to these rules may be characters under level 3 who
are just learning mudding and role playing for the first time.  After
that, all rules stand.  If it really means that much to your character,
its more often a better show of devotion to just delete and start over as
a sign of your true change of heart as well as comitment to the change. 
Otherwise, it probably wasn't that important to you.  The last stands for
a level 80 as much as it does for a level 10 character.)
