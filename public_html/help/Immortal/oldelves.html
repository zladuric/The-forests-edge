There are two main races of Elves on the Forest's Edge, the llewyrr or
Eleint, and the Vyans, or Dark Elves.  See help <span style="color:blue;">Vyan</span> for information
about the Dark Elves.

The Eleint (or &quot;llewyrr&quot;) make their home in the grand wood known as the
<span style="color:blue;">Vaasa</span>, and seek to rid the forest of evil creatures.  Due to the wood's
great size and the many perilous areas with which it borders, this is a
constant and neverending struggle.

The Eleint are known for their unique style of dress.  They generally
favor forest colors, ranging from deep green to soft browns.  Their hair
ranges from light blond to darkish brown and, rarely, black, with their
skin tone similarly varied.  Also, full-blooded eleint have no facial
hair.  Their hair is typically straight, and the Eleint are known to be
fond of weaving beads into their coifs which represent various aspects of
that particular individual's beliefs, background, family, etc.  The
Eleint typically stand 5' in height, sometimes a bit taller or shorter,
and are slender in girth.  Eye color is varied, with browns and blues
being the most common.

The Eleint have developed a substantial sense of group identity and
cohesion among themselves; some speculate that this is due to their
status as athe children of an 'elder' race, but this is unproven and an
issue of dispute among the greatest sages of the realm.  Nonetheless, the
Eleint are known for their respect given toward the natural world, with
all natural things considered to house a sacred spirit, be they elven,
animal, plant, rock, or soil.

Over the years, however, hard lessons have taught the surface elves to
mistrust outsiders.  Beyond their unmitigated <span style="color:blue;"></span><span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;">hatred</span> for all Vyans,
the Eleint possess a healthy suspicion of many races, and have become
outright hostile to others.  Dwarves and Gnomes, though overly
materialistic and concerned with trivialities, are races whose level of
pollution has not yet progressed past their being saved.  Humans, for
their part, are considered to be intemperate and immoderate, prone to
acting first and considering the consequences of their actions later, and
substantial ill-feeling exists between the Eleint and Humans due to
several pastwars and untoward actions, on both sides.

Despite their misgivings with Humanity, the expediency of survival has
forced the Eleint to cooperate - begrudgingly - with humans in the face
of a greater threat.  Posing such a threat are Orcs, Trolls, Ogres, and
Goblins, who along with Vyans are considered as unnatural, twisted
abominations who should be wiped from existence, their very presence an
oozing, infected and diseased wound threatening to destroy the realm.
The Eleint will not associate with these races under any condition,
