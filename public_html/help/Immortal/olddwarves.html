Famous for deeds other than the invention of the braided beard and the
double-bladed axe, the Dwarves of the Forest's Edge are known to make
fine warriors and adventurers.  Strong and hardy, Dwarves also possess a
certain innate resistance to magic which makes members of this race
particularly valuable allies and extremely deadly foes.  The Dwarves of
Clan Khedrun make their home in the great underground city of Kha-Da, and

although they don't much like the annoying brightness which is the sun,
in typical fashion, Dwarves have learned to make do with sunlight, even
if it still irks them.

Dwarves have, in general, an undying hatred for several races - among
them Goblins, Orcs, Trolls and Ogres.  Above all, Dwarves cannot stand
Goblins, who to them are less than worthless thieves who should be buried
alive in the next collapsed tunnel.  Needless to say, Goblins conceive of
Dwarves in similar terms.  Elves are viewed with a measure of skepticism,
at times bordering upon open contempt, and Vyans are perceived as a
particularly sinister threat.  Humans, on the whole, are seen as
unnecessarily volatile and a race which really hasn't finished
adolesence, grown up, and figured out what it wants to do with itself. 
Lizardmen are a bit of a boggle for Dwarves, while Gnomes are considered
to be the most agreeable, sensible of fellows, next to other dwarves, of
course.
