Druids are the guardians of nature and are bestowed with gifts of magic to
enable them to protect their habitat.  Typically a druid will pick one area
and protect it from outside hazards, however, younger druids are known to
wander the land learning what they can from all the different habitats they
can observe before settling down.  All druids are at home with nature and find
civilization to be somewhat unsettling as most civilized races must coerce the
land and its nature to make it &quot;civilized&quot;.

Druids are in many ways similar to rangers in their love of nature and the
abilities given them.  Where a ranger can be said to be the physical warrior
of nature the druid is gifted more strongly in the way of magic.  Druidic
spells are primarily concerned with effects found in nature.  The ability to
mimic plant and animal effects or the effects of the elements themselves.
Druids are also given some ability to repair the wounds of the world and heal
wounds.

Druids will not use bladed weapons since bladed weapons are one of the
greatest threats to a forest's growth and well being.  They also typically
avoid the use of metal armor as it both requires significant damage to unearth
most times and interfers with their magics.  The lesser amount of metals in
such weapons as mace heads and hammer heads are considered a tolerable cost to
accept in lieu of their ability to safely wield in defending the woods.

druids, see the help file on <span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">Abilities</span>.
