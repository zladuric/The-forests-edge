<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;"></span><span style="color:blue;">Multiplaying policies of TFE:</span>
  
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;"></span><span style="color:blue;">*</span> Multiplaying is defined as having more than one character, both
controlled by the same real-life person, logged onto the MUD simultaneously
or within 5 minutes of each other.  You may create as many characters on your
account(s) as you like, but you may not multiplay them.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;"></span><span style="color:blue;">*</span> Multiplaying is not allowed.  It gives too much of an advantage over
those who cannot do it.  It also promotes soloing and works against the social
structure of the MUD.
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;"></span><span style="color:blue;">*</span> Players may not trade equipment between their own characters, nor may
they assist others in doing so.  You may not create a new character and give
him equipment from an old character, even if you delete the old one.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;"></span><span style="color:blue;">*</span> The Immortals of TFE insist that all players wait five minutes before
logging alternate characters on.  In addition, players may not log in and out
frequently in order to speed up area resets.  This also includes constant
voiding in areas.
   
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;"></span><span style="color:blue;">*</span> Each account may have only one character on at a time, and playing
multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted.  This rule
extends to equipment trading and the 5-minute rule as well...  even if you've
cleverly managed to create multiple accounts, characters in all your accounts
are subject to these rules, as if they were all under the same account.
  
<span style="font-weight:bold; color:red;"></span><span style="color:blue;">Multiplayers may reasonably expect themselves to be purged.
