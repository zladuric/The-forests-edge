<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Player Names</span> - Players should choose a name that fits their character
and the medieval time period.  Immortals are encouraged to be lenient in
enforcing this, but characters with blatantly unacceptable names will be
asked to change them.  Examples of unacceptable names are Television,
GoBlue and IamGreat.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Immortal Help</span> - minor help is allowed for players lower than level 3
such as giving food when starving, giving clues when lost or finding
corpse in deadly places.  This is to stop the mud from being too
frustrating.  After level 2 no help is allowed unless in cases of bugs. 
Both players and immortals will be disciplined for this.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Abusing Bugs</span> - If you find a bug please report it.  Abusing a bugs can
ruin the game for everyone and therefore players will be punished for
such abuse.  If it is too good to be true, it probably is, and you'd
better report it.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Reimbs</span> - Reimbursements may be given in some cases for losses due to
major bugs.  The normal reimbursement is the equipment you had as of the
last backup of the player files.  This may not be all that you lost but
eliminates the problem of lying so no other equipment reimbursement will
be given.  Deaths or losses due to lag are not eligible for
reimbursements.  Items lost in a crash are not eligible for reimbursement
unless they were lost on a corpse.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Multi Playing</span> - Multi Playing is not allowed.  It gives too much of
an advantage over those who cannot do it.  It also promotes solo'ing and
works against the social structure of the mud.  Similarly, players should
not trade equipment between their own characters, or assist others in
doing so.  Each account may have only one character on at a time, and
playing multiple characters via multiple accounts is also not permitted. 
Multiplayers may reasonably expect themselves to be purged.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">5-Minute Rule</span> - A corollary to the rule against multiplaying.  This
rule applies to those players with more than one character.  To switch
playing one character for another, you must wait AT LEAST five minutes
before connecting as the new or 'second' character.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Death Traps</span> - Death traps ruin the fun of exploring and make life
frustrating.  Areas will not contain 'automatic death' traps.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Language</span> - We ask that players not curse or use offensive language. 
While it is impossible for Immortals to monitor all channels all the
time, we ask that you police yourselves and that you please be sensitive
to your company, both those in the room with you, in the area, and on the
mud as a whole.  Players have complained about this in the past, and
minors do log on here.  Please be considerate to others during your stay
at The Forest's Edge.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">&quot;Bots&quot;</span> - An integral aspect of mudding is its social dimension. 
Bots, or automated scripts, undermine this through the removal of the
human element from the game.  The reduction of the game to a repetitive
series of scripted actions undercuts the roleplaying environment which we
seek to foster at The Forest's Edge.  As a result, players are not
permitted to run or use bots.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Triggers</span> - Limited use of triggers is permitted.  Use of triggers to run your
character while you are not attending the session is botting and is not
allowed.  Use of triggers to permit another player to run your character
remotely is not permitted.  Each player is responsible for their own character.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">Item/Mob Stats</span> -TFE has had a long-standing policy asking that players do not
give out stats for items, mobs, quests, etc over public channels.  In a group
or between friends such information is often shared but please refrain from
discussing the details on public channels.  Public channels would be chat,
gossip, atalk, newbie or any similar channel.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:white;">&quot;Area stealing&quot;</span> -We ask the players who encounter other players or groups who
are also adventuring in the same area as you or your group to work things out
peacefully on your own without involving the immortals.  It is strongly
encouraged that players learn how to share or work out other arrangements when
involved in such a situation.  However, harassment and intentional abuse of
other players will not be tolerated.
