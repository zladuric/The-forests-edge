<span style="font-weight:bold; color:blue;">92 - Apprentice:</span>
A builder or administrator in training.  This person has very limited
power but is being given the opportunity to learn the commands, see how
areas are developed and assist the mentor they are assigned to.  An
apprentice has not yet defined whether he will be a builder or
administrator.

<span style="color:cyan;">93 - Builder:</span>
The standard builder rank.  Builders make the bulk of the immortals in
the game.  Many builders share different responsibilities.  Most focus on
building new areas but some are more involved with reviewing those areas
or making sure new equipment is fair and follows the standards laid down
by the Architect.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;">94 - Architect:</span>
The senior builder.  This person organizes building throughout the mud on
a large scale, and all areas must pass the Architect's approval both
before construction and before opening.  The Architect also organizes any
situations that require the Angel or Administrators involvement in new
areas.

<span style="color:magenta;">95 - Immortal:</span>
The standard administrator rank.  Immortals are responsible for several
tasks.  An Immortal is responsible for investigating any cases of
cheating on the mud, and for this reason has the ability to observe
almost any form of communication on the mud.  The Immortals are also
responsible for fixing any bugs found on the mud, and relaying their
status to the players.  The Immortals also act as the public figures,
replying to any notes or requests calling for divine intervention.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:magenta;">96 - Spirit:</span>
The senior administrator level.  The spirit has the same responsibilities
as an Immortal but also has the power to ban players, reimburse equipment
and is the authority all Immortal Ranks must appeal to for questionable
decisions.  The spirit is in charge of making sure the game runs smoothly
and no cheating is occurring in the game.  He has the right to assign
Immortals to whatever assignment he feels is in the best interest of the
mud.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:green;">97 - Angel:</span>
The Angel is responsible for all spells, skill, and class related
modifications.  Devising new spells, balancing out trainers, and creating
quests for those skills are all the responsibility of the Angel.  Other
involvements include religion and racial affects as well general
balancing of the classes on the mud.

<span style="font-weight:bold; color:yellow;">98 - Demigod:</span>
The Demigod is the absolute authority and manager of the other Immortals. 
The Architect, Spirit and Angel all report to this position and he
coordinates any collaboration needed.  This person is also in charge of
hiring new immortals, and avatars as well as organizing their status on
the mud.  Any questionable decisions should be brought to the Demigod's
attention for a final verdict.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">99 - God:</span>
The owner of the MUD and the authority on such technical issues like
modifications of the source code and any tasks relating to the physical
server the game resides on.  The ultimate authority over everything on
the MUD.
