Historically, a generic 'sword' weight about 3 pounds.

German long swords were from 48 to 52 inches in length, with a grip long
enough for two hands but light enough to wield one-handed from horseback.

The blades became chewed up very quickly when fighting until about the
18th century or so, when they simply stopped sharpening them so much (&quot;a
thin bar of steel still does quite a bit of damage when you hit someone
very hard with it&quot;).

My advice for the future of swords at TFE would be that when a builder
creates a sword, they should determine the metal, the length, width, and
thickness of the blade.  And perhaps a rating of craftsmanship, or
something or other, which has effects on the durability and balance of
the weapon.  However the sword's material and dimensions should determine
its weight, which in turn determines its damage along with current
condition of the blade.

The material determines the durability and expense of sharpening the
blade.

But perhaps the most important (to me) is improving swordplay in general. 
Very rarely would a skilled swordsman sit there and slash, slash, slash. 
Based on the dimensions of the blade (and its weight) and the swordsman's
skill, there should be thrusting, chopping, and, of course, the feint.

A skilled and intelligent swordsman would not keep hitting an opponent's
plate mail, either.  They would be aiming for a leg, arm, or other
exposed target.

A thrust wound of about two inches is usually fatal.  Slashing could do a
lot of collateral damage, such as severed muscles and broken bones.
