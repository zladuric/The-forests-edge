<span style="font-weight:bold; color:cyan;"></span><span style="color:blue;">METALS OF THE REALM</span>
  
<span style="color:blue;">Copper</span>
A soft, abundant, easily mined metal, copper is cheapest coin of the
realm.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Silver</span>
Soft and gleaming, silver is rarer and more valuable than copper.  One
piece of silver is worth ten pieces of copper.
 
<span style="color:blue;">Gold</span>
Most of the gold of the realm comes from the mines of the industrious
Dwarves of Kha-Da.  Gold is a rare, extremely heavy metal.  One piece of
gold equal ten pieces of silver.
 
<span style="color:blue;">Platinum</span>
Earlier finders of platinum condemned it as &quot;false silver&quot; and threw it
into the ocean.  They came to learn the value of the hard, light metal,
however.  Platinum is silver-white, is very rare, and quite expensive. 
One platinum piece equals ten pieces of gold.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Bronze</span>
Soft, malleable, and plentiful, bronze was the first metal used by
mortals for making weapons and armor.  The practice of using bronze has
not gone out of style, however, because bronze is inexpensive and easily
replaceable.  Bronze is usually impure, thus bronze weapons and armor are
inordinately heavy.  Also, because the metal is so soft, it tends to
blunt easily.  Bronze tends to be easy to enchant.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Iron</span>
A heavy, hard metal, iron is the most prominent material used in weapon
making.  It can be forged by even apprentice blacksmiths, and is abundant
enough to be relatively cheap.  Found deep in the earth, iron tends to be
impure, and is therefore heavy.  It does not blunt readily as bronze,
however, so consqeuently is ideal for armor and edged weapons.  Iron is
fairly easy to enchant.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Steel</span>
Steel is iron which has been super-heated to boil out impurities. 
Extremely hard, steel is surprisingly light-weight.  Steel weapons will
keep their edges, and steel armor will not dent easily.  Because only
experienced blacksmiths can work with steel, it is quite expensive.  The
Dwarves generally claim to have discovered steel, as only their mighty
forges could have produced enough heat to draw steel from iron.  Steel is
very disruptive to mage spells, and it tends to resist enchantment.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Electrum</span>
A rare alloy consisting of gold, silver and copper, electrum is
silver-gold in color, is lighter than gold, and is quite soft. 
Therefore, it tends not to last when forged into weapons and armor. 
However, ancient mages discovered that electrum is extremely receptive to
magic, so much so that it does not hinder a mage's spell-casting ability.
Purified electrum, suitable for spellcasters, often has a faint blue glow to
it - this is often amplified by enchantments that are weaved through it.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Mithril</span>
The process of creating mithril is one of the most guarded secrets of the
elves, whose ancients were said to have worn suits of enchanted mithril
chainmail.  However, though no outsiders know how to create mithril, many
know how to forge it.  Several master blacksmiths claim to have learned
the secret of shaping the incredibly hard, lighweight metal.  Mithril is
a bright, almost white, glimmering silver color.  Among metals, it is
second only to adamantite in hardness.  Unlike adamantite, however,
mithril is easier to enchant, although it does hinder a mage's spell
casting ability.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Krynite</span>
Rumors abound concerning the origins of the strange, dark purple metal. 
The most popular of these rumors is that the metal came from an ancient
race of godlings, whose weapons of krynite sank into the ground of the
battlefield where they destroyed themselves in a terrifying war.
Whatever its origins, krynite is undoubtedly magic in nature.  All
krynite exudes a soft, pallid glow, which fades as the metal gets
fatigued.  However, because every pore of the metal is infused with
magic, it will always resist infusions of further energy, such as
enchantment.  Krynite will not interfere with a mage's spell casting
ability.  The metal is incredibly expensive, and so difficult to work
with that only a genius could ever hope to forge it.
  
<span style="color:blue;">Adamantite</span>
Almost nothing is known about this rare, dull-gray metal.  It is said
that those who discovered and could forge the metal have all died. 
Another rumor holds that adamantite is so hard that it can be forged only
with the combination of a giant's strength and archmage's magic. 
Adamantite is second only to diamond in hardness.  A warrior's metal,
adamantite makes incalculably valuable weapons and armor.  It is
extremely difficult to enchant, and is, for mages, the most disruptive
material known.

<span style="color:blue;">Titanium</span>
Little is known about this lustrous gray metal, only tales from elder master
weaponsmiths and armorers who praise its unrivaled strength and durability.
They claim that when the gods themselves were in mortal form, wielded weapons
and armor crafted out of this powerful metal.  Legend has it that only one
person truly knows the secret to harnessing titanium into usable form, but no
one seems to recall who that person is by name.
